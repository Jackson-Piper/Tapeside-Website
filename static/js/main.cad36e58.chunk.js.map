The Project is planned to come in two\r\n          different parts, the application, and the physical device which will help the application to monitor\r\n          temperature and be connected to heating and cooling systems.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          The sensor and application are being put together by both Oscar and Miles as they have the most experience in\r\n          this field. We are planning to have it running and operational so it can send data to a phone anywhere and\r\n          receive instructions from said phone. It consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 running the standard Raspberry Pi OS\r\n          (Linux based, GUI) and Arduino sensors, wired into a breadboard. There are three main sensor components, the\r\n          LM35 Temperature Sensor, the MQ-3 Alcohol Vapor sensor and the SGP30 Air Quality Sensor. The purpose of these\r\n          sensors is to read the temperature (LM35) of the fermenting brew so that the yeast can survive and convert\r\n          sugars. The Air Sensor (SGP30) is to detect Co2, which is a sign that the yeast is active and finally the\r\n          alcohol vapor sensor (MQ-3) to detect when the brew has finished fermentation and alcohol is present. It does\r\n          this by having a constant reading of the latter two sensors over a period of 2 to 3 consecutive days.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          The application side will present the data collected by the Arduino sensors and passed to the user’s phone so\r\n          that they can remotely monitor fermentation temperatures and adjust accordingly, with plans to have this part\r\n          automated as well. There are also plans to store this data for future brews so that the same method can be\r\n          used to help replicate the exact fermentation process as well as templates that can be used depending on the\r\n          different brews.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          The result at the end of a very long trial and error process would be to have an all-in-one fermenter vessel\r\n          and fridge that allows users to place an unfermented wort into the device then set and forget. The system\r\n          would monitor all the data from temperature, carbon dioxide emissions and lastly the alcohol vapour to ensure\r\n          the brew was completed in the correct amount of time. The last steps of Cold Crashing would be an optional\r\n          feature, but once the system detects the brew is finished it can go into a “holding” phase until the brewer is\r\n          ready to bottle or keg.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <b><u><h4>Motivation</h4></u></b>\r\n          Like our previous project Idea, an audio Virtual Machine to be used by Streamers, which came from Oscar who\r\n          had a need for this. Yeast is a project that Miles discussed and as a group we believed it was more within our\r\n          grasp, the skills that are present in the group came into much consideration when deciding whether to change\r\n          the project plan but ultimately it was in the best interest of the group to make this change. Miles’s idea\r\n          came from fermentation being the most important step in the brewing process the need to monitor temperature is\r\n          paramount to this. While working remote Miles’s access to his home brewing setup was obviously limited and a\r\n          gap in the market was found which we are now exploring options for. We noticed with the rise of craft beer\r\n          popularity and the recent pandemic more and more people are looking to create their own brews. In the modern\r\n          age being able to automate the final (and arguably the most important) part of the brewing process seems like\r\n          a natural progression of home brewing.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <b><u><h4>Landscape</h4></u></b>\r\n          While similar devices are available to the market such as Precision Fermentation’s BREWMONITER, they are\r\n          designed for commercial sized tanks and do not consider the needs of home brewers. We have downsized such\r\n          designs so that they do not require a large amount of space and simplified the application as individual tank\r\n          size and overall production size is often smaller than a fraction of that of commercial breweries. While they\r\n          all have the same structure of monitoring heat, temperature and pressure, the simplified method of our sleek\r\n          design and portability is where we stand out to our competitors.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          Presently there are a few similar systems that are in circulation, such as the BrewPi\r\n          <Endnote\r\n            tooltip=\"1\"\r\n            placement=\"bottom\"\r\n            note=\"BrewPi - Brewing Automation\"\r\n            link=\"https://www.brewpi.com/\"\r\n          />\r\n          , the iSpindel\r\n          <Endnote\r\n            tooltip=\"2\"\r\n            placement=\"bottom\"\r\n            note=\"iSpindle Documentation | iSpindel\"\r\n            link=\"https://www.ispindel.de/docs/README_en.html\"\r\n          />\r\n          , the Tilt\r\n          <Endnote\r\n            tooltip=\"3\"\r\n            placement=\"bottom\"\r\n            note=\"Tilt™ Hydrometer and Thermometer – Tilt Hydrometer\"\r\n            link=\"https://tilthydrometer.com/products/copy-of-tilt-floating-wireless-hydrometer-and-thermometer-for-brewing\"\r\n          />\r\n          {\" \"}and the Plaato\r\n          <Endnote\r\n            tooltip=\"4\"\r\n            placement=\"bottom\"\r\n            note=\"PLAATO - Digitalising Brewing\"\r\n            link=\"https://plaato.io/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhr2FBhDbARIsACjwLo0psl7qYGs7rCDOCSV4xS-gyDJ3LeHwSijNYgqXRoC6znieL0MJSUcaAjwjEALw_wcB\"\r\n          />\r\n          .\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          Each of these devices has one specialised function, the BrewPi that monitors the temperature and can turn the\r\n          temp on and off in a (pre hacked\r\n          <Endnote\r\n            tooltip=\"5\"\r\n            placement=\"bottom\"\r\n            note=\"The Fridge Hacking Guide By BrewPi | Hackaday\"\r\n            link=\"https://hackaday.com/2014/08/03/the-fridge-hacking-guide-by-brewpi/\"\r\n          />\r\n          ) Fridge. This device only reads the data then changes the temperature. There\r\n          is no additional data input like our device has, such as the CO2 output and Alcohol Vapour readings.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          The closest of the aforementioned gadgets would be the Plaato Airlock, which measures the specific gravity of\r\n          your beer during fermentation and transmits the data every fifth minute to the PLAATO App through Wi-Fi. This\r\n          doesn’t have any temperature control or other functionality besides allowing the user to view the data.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          Additionally, the Tilt and iSpindel are essentially the same device just made with Arduino parts only, no\r\n          controlling system such as Raspberry Pi. These are placed into the fermenting brew itself (as in floating) and\r\n          function much like the Plaato but instead read the gravity of the brew internally. Largely speaking these\r\n          devices aren't popular as most brewers do not like risking anything going into the brew that could cause an\r\n          infection.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          Our device looks to be able to read all the above information, then in later iterations be able to control the\r\n          entire brew automatically, by using multiple sensors and devices but with no risk to the brew from outside\r\n          influences.\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/FermenSensorPi.6665e8ab.png\";","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ContentCard from \"../../components/ContentCard\";\r\nimport Endnote from \"../../components/Endnote\";\r\n\r\nimport FermenSensorPi from \"../../assets/images/project/FermenSensorPi.png\"\r\n\r\nexport default class Description extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <ContentCard align=\"center\" width=\"400px\">\r\n          <h2>Description</h2>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <strong>The FermenSensorPi</strong>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            During fermentation, yeast consumes the sugars found in the wort (sugar liquid) and creates both alcohol and\r\n            carbon dioxide as byproducts.

This, first of three systems,\r\n            below is designed to read these byproducts then compare them to a database of “what this should look like”.\r\n            After taking that reading, it can communicate with additional units to control temperature, both heating and\r\n            cooling, to ensure the fermentation is proceeding in a desired manner. The outcome of this should be to have\r\n            repeatable brews, initially the lager beer type, that are mostly automated after the wort is placed into the\r\n            fermenter and fermentation fridge.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The first of these is <a target=\"_blank\"\r\n                                     href={\"https://www.circuito.io/app?components=9443,35286,200000,333429,398783\"}>a\r\n            Raspberry Pi with Temp and CO2 sensors</a> as well as an alcohol detector.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <strong>The Pi:</strong>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The base of this unit is a Raspberry Pi 3, Model B\r\n            <Endnote\r\n              tooltip=\"1\"\r\n              placement=\"bottom\"\r\n              note=\"Buy a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B – Raspberry Pi\"\r\n              link=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/\"\r\n            />\r\n            .

The aim for this project is to help home brewers create the optimum fermentation\r\n            environment when making beer. Its purpose, initially, is to remind and instruct users to change temperatures\r\n            whilst in the process of the home brewing. Once the device and app was working as planned it would allow for\r\n            full automation of this process with the users being able to simply monitor (a watched pot never boils!) the\r\n            brews progress. This device would need the user to connect and run the system, as well as any equipment used\r\n            in the brewing process, but this would be straightforward enough so long as they had a small amount of\r\n            computer/gadget literacy. Within the brew, sensors would be used to detect any changes in the fermentation\r\n            and internal data would be put into activated to alert the user that a change has been made to the brew, or\r\n            if set to a manual option then to re-adjust the configuration of their setup.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The goal of this device would be to help home brewers achieve the desired brew. The fermentation is THE MOST\r\n            IMPORTANT step in the brewing process as it controls how the ale’s result will eventually be. A failed\r\n            fermentation can produce off flavours, or worse become undrinkable. The device's goal is to read sensor data\r\n            to see how well the yeast cells are performing within the brew. The key is to keep the consistency of the\r\n            fermentation process at the optimum temperature which is usually around 18-22c, depending on the brew type.\r\n            The reasoning behind keeping the temperature at this range is to produce the ester compounds from the yeast,\r\n            the ester compounds are what gives the beer its flavour this is from the yeast growing and multiplying and\r\n            that creates the ester compound. The yeast is available to create ester from yeast characteristics; wort\r\n            composition and fermentation conditions and this project would assist in the fermentation process creating\r\n            what people want which they “just want beer that tastes like real beer“. A simple process in theory, but in\r\n            practice it has to be carefully monitored and maintained to ensure the final result can be placed into a mug\r\n            and toasted amongst friends (responsibly!)\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Plans and Progress</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Originally, we started assignment 2 with an application for streamers to use to allow them to have music\r\n            playing without risking copyright infringements against them, but the team decided that project wasn’t one\r\n            that we all felt we could contribute and work on together. We bandied about a few different ideas such as a\r\n            system that aggregated VOD (streaming services) into one central place and allowed users to select shows\r\n            from a central hub that was in their paid stream selections. We discussed this idea but worried about\r\n            copyright and the legality of a system like this. While it was an interesting idea it wasn’t something\r\n            everyone had a great deal of interest in.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            After a bit of discussion, the group decided that a system to help with home brewing, specifically the\r\n            fermentation side, would be both a challenge as well as interesting for everyone in the group. The basic\r\n            idea was to have a system that could monitor temperature and emissions and then automate the temperature\r\n            control side based on additional parameters. We knew there was a system –the BrewPi – as well as couple\r\n            others that did temperature control, but it was based only on that - the temperature.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            No other system considered the yeast activity levels by measuring the carbon dioxide emissions as well as\r\n            the alcohol vapour levels to perform automation.Thus, this new project idea was born. While we didn’t have a\r\n            clever name for it, we simply called it “Project: Yeast”. Presently this name has not changed but a few\r\n            ideas such as “FermenSensorPi” and Brew-o -Matic were thrown around.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The first steps to even get this project started was to fork our original GitHub repository and strip out\r\n            the unnecessary elements from Assignment 2.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b>Oscar</b> was the first to get underway with the theory side by the following:\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b>Oscar:</b> “I have created the Java files we will need for the device and am currently writing comments\r\n            and\r\n            empty\r\n            methods to then implement functionality after I know which sensors will be used and how to calculate the\r\n            data. The next step I will be taking is creating configuration files. Once I have the data needed to add the\r\n            sensor data collection, I will implement that and create calculations to be run.”At this point we knew we\r\n            had the base line software and coding available, at least based on the research that had been done by Oscar.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b>Miles</b> then went online to try and see if an Arduino board or a Raspberry Pi would make for a better\r\n            controller, upon finding some information online it turned out that there were multiple sensors for\r\n            everything we had planned to implement.

Downloaded Raspberry Pi OS to\r\n            MicroSD\r\n            card to push install once the prototype is ready to be worked on some more.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Meanwhile, <b>Szedhane</b> and <b>Jackson</b> filmed their “News” segment and edited it.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Also, during this, <b>Szedhane</b> wrote up the aims of this project as well as the as the roles required.\r\n            He\r\n            included some “dream team” job titles to show what level the ultimate finished product would need to have to\r\n            be considered a professional and quality product.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b>Oscar:</b> Wrote up Tools and Tech document. Will begin on career plans document tomorrow as well as\r\n            working on\r\n            the website.He also took the time to find existing, open source, code for the various sensors so that he can\r\n            program the device to read and interpret the data.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b>Miles:</b> has built the Project: Yeast device! It took a fair bit of research and ton of trial and error\r\n            to\r\n            achieve this, but we now have a physical device, complete with Raspberry Pi Operating System installed as\r\n            well as a fully wired-up breadboard with all the breakout boards wired in:\r\n            <img src={Proto}/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            As well as a prototype:\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <img src={Proto1}/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            This isn't the ideal spot for the device but given it is a prototype and doesn’t have a housing this would\r\n            have to suffice.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            While the prototype has been built, we were unable to get testing done properly as the team is located all\r\n            over Australia and <b>Miles</b> works away from home, the device couldn’t be shipped safely or in time to be\r\n            programmed.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            This is the one thing that we really wanted to be able to do within the timeframe that we had but if we were\r\n            given an extra week or so this would definitely be, at a minimum, programmed to read sensor data.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            A brew would also need to be made for this but as a brew takes two weeks to ferment, we would need to have\r\n            someone monitor the process, as stated above <b>Miles</b> (our head brewer!) is away and can’t make a batch\r\n            of beer\r\n            yet.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b>Oscar:</b> Has now added content to website for the project and preparing the pages for other components\r\n            of the assessment.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b>Jackson</b> has finished writing the Group Process document, which needed to be done near the very end of\r\n            the project.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The rest of the team is taking the time to reflect on the last few weeks and get ready to finalise the\r\n            project.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b><u>This is as far as we managed to get as a team.</u></b>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b><u>The future:</u></b>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            As a part of a handover, we would advise anyone else (even our own team) to focus on the sensor\r\n            configuration first and foremost, once this is readable then you can start the testing phase to see that the\r\n            information being gathered is useful and viable.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Once that is confirmed (fingers crossed) then beginning work on creating a companion app that can monitor\r\n            the information is second – it doesn’t matter if it is a desktop application or mobile specific but\r\n            something that can allow the user to see the data being generated, ideally, in real time.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            After these are completed, the next part is configuring the R-Pi to control the fridge cooling system and a\r\n            heat pad. This will prove the trickiest part of the whole operation as you would be working with “dumb”\r\n            devices. One of these is a system that monitors the internal temperature of the fridge and then just turns\r\n            the fridge off (or on) for temp control but we want to be able to push this to do it at our devices command,\r\n            rather than just by its own programmed variable.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            This will likely require an additional unit to be constructed. This can be a much simpler Arduino IoT device\r\n            that communicates with the main control system – The Raspberry Pi/Sensor array. This part would be highly\r\n            complicated and will need help from an electrical engineer or someone similar (and qualified).\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Another thing that would be amazing would be to have a housing made, quite likely with a 3D Printer, so it\r\n            can be customised depending on how we want the device to look and access for the sensors to the atmosphere\r\n            within the fermentation chamber.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Roles</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <ul><strong><u>Roles for the Project</u></strong></ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              Defining roles for such a large project is very useful and can be a huge benefit to a team’s overall\r\n              performance and functionality. Positions being allocated are usually brought upon by themselves since some\r\n              people have certain skills in certain roles, for example having a person who has an excellent\r\n              understanding of app development, operating systems and computing skills are usually given a job as <i>Lead\r\n              Developer</i> and someone who has a creative mind, understands the goals/aims deeply and is not afraid to\r\n              take\r\n              risks should be given a role like a technical designer. Defining roles for participants is very beneficial\r\n              in the grand scheme of things as it bypasses past any unclear air that can cause any tension between the\r\n              team.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Roles can be changed throughout the duration of a project and roles can also be shared if need be.\r\n              Positions in a team are set for functionality to achieve optimum performance, the purpose of having roles\r\n              and positions is to make sure that every single task is accomplished in an orderly way and to not cause\r\n              any confusion or any dilemma, if a certain task is finished and the role thereby becomes no longer needed\r\n              then it is possible for roles to be changed or in a better way shared / helped with. For the benefit of a\r\n              team’s cohesion, it is better to have roles shared and not changed and if someone’s role is changed that\r\n              may cause them to feel like their skills are not wanted but for roles to be shared it creates a sense of\r\n              comradery and great team chemistry plus it shows how well people within a team can work together on the\r\n              same task.\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <ul><strong><u>What roles would we like?</u></strong></ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              For our project there were several defined roles that could have been implemented, but due to the nature\r\n              of the device and its very early stages, these roles are more so “dream roles” to have working on the\r\n              project.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              The first role that was partly defined was the ‘Head Brewer’. This position was a must for the project as\r\n              it needed to create the brews that the device will be monitoring. This person needs to be able to relay\r\n              information to the development team on how a fermentation works and why this device is needed, this role\r\n              is vital for the project because if the project did not have the role of <i>brewer</i> no one would know\r\n              how to\r\n              use the application and give feedback on how the project is achieving its goal of getting <i>“beer that\r\n              takes\r\n              like real beer“.</i>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Had we continued with this trend, the next role would be the role of Software Engineer, this role is\r\n              desired because without a software engineer there would no application/software further down the project\r\n              timeline. This role is the backbone to the future of this project as the job is to create and to design\r\n              the software that can collect and read the data from the device. This role would be considered crucial to\r\n              the project because without a software engineer/’s there simply no project, this role demands knowledge\r\n              into C++ and Python as the project needs these code languages to write with a Raspberry Pi and Arduino.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Given that this is a very data heavy project, another key role would be that of the Data Analyst. This\r\n              role describes itself, but to explain why we would need this is because the purpose of a data analyst is\r\n              to collect, collate and interpret data for the project. They would be able to analyse the data to turn\r\n              into accurate information, which can be used and refined further down the project line. This role is\r\n              defined for its high demand in reading the data and being able to turn the information collected into\r\n              reliable feedback for the team to process and make educated decisions on the next steps.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Finally, the last “dream role” would be a Project Manager qualified with PMP and Agile as they would be\r\n              able to run the entire project from start to finish, while keeping everyone's tasks in check and having\r\n              accountability. As no one in this team has ever met before and everyone is unsure of each other's\r\n              abilities a centralised manager who can direct and manage the project would be an absolute blessing. This\r\n              would be beneficial in ANY team environment, especially one that requires application building and\r\n              testing.\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <ul><strong><u>Why didn’t we choose to allocate roles? </u></strong></ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              Within this project there haven't been any specific roles assigned, mostly in part to everyone being new\r\n              to the Information Technology Project scene. It is hard to define a role as “RedHat Linux Programmer” or\r\n              “Lead Software Engineer” for someone who is, for example, a chef by trade. With that in mind, it is also a\r\n              group assignment and by that virtue all parts of the work needed to be shared out equally or at least as\r\n              equal as everyone's scope and abilities are concerned. Going back to the very first paragraph here,\r\n              “Positions being allocated are usually brought upon by themselves since some people have certain skills in\r\n              certain roles” we trusted everyone to step in and assist where they could do as much as possible.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              For example:\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Oscar understands GitHub and the website creation much better than Szedhane, but Szedhane can draft\r\n              storyboards and shoot videos comfortably. Miles can type and write 1000s of words quickly but can't edit\r\n              videos as well as Jackson.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              The team also understands that we all work full time jobs while doing this course part time, so the\r\n              important thing is one person is checking to make sure we are progressing and making progress before the\r\n              deadline. We all took turns at checking in and making sure things were going as well as possible.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              With that being said, we would have our reflections at the end this project to see if our methodology\r\n              worked, or not. The proof will be in the drinking.\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              That role that needs to be defined is the Data Analyst, this role describes itself. The purpose of a\r\n              data analyst is to collect data for the projects device and be able to analyse the data to turn into\r\n              accurate\r\n              information. This role is defined for its high demand in reading the data and being able to turn the\r\n              information collected into reliable feedback to user for creating that “beer that tastes like real beer“.\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Timeframe</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <TableContainer id=\"timeframe-table\" component={Paper}>\r\n            <Table>\r\n              <TableHead>\r\n                <TableRow>\r\n                  <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}} align=\"center\">\r\n                    <strong> </strong>\r\n                  </TableCell>\r\n                  <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}} align=\"center\">\r\n                    <strong>Szedhane: 36 hours</strong>\r\n                  </TableCell>\r\n                  <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}} align=\"center\">\r\n                    <strong>Hans: 36 hours</strong>\r\n                  </TableCell>\r\n                  <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}} align=\"center\">\r\n                    <strong>Oscar: 36 hours</strong>\r\n                  </TableCell>\r\n                  <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}} align=\"center\">\r\n                    <strong>Jackson: 36 hours</strong>\r\n                  </TableCell>\r\n                  <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}} align=\"center\">\r\n                    <strong>Miles: 36 hours</strong>\r\n                  </TableCell>\r\n                </TableRow>\r\n              </TableHead>\r\n              <TableBody>\r\n                {this.rows.map((row) => (\r\n                  <TableRow key={row.name}>\r\n                    <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}}><strong>{row.week}</strong></TableCell>\r\n                    <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}}>{row.szedhane}</TableCell>\r\n                    <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}}>{row.hans}</TableCell>\r\n                    <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}}>{row.oscar}</TableCell>\r\n                    <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}}>{row.jackson}</TableCell>\r\n                    <TableCell style={{color: \"white\"}}>{row.miles}</TableCell>\r\n                  </TableRow>\r\n                ))}\r\n              </TableBody>\r\n            </Table>\r\n          </TableContainer>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Group Process</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Similarly, to Assignment Two the main tool for our group’s communication will be through Microsoft Teams.\r\n            This application available both on our mobile devices and computers allows a constant connection between\r\n            each team member that is not as slow or easy to ignore as other methods of communication such as Email or\r\n            Facebook. This application has everything a team could need from file sharing to task allocation.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The communication will be broken down into two parts, messaging, and meetings. The chat function within\r\n            teams is the informal instant messaging approach that will consist of on the fly updating/assessing and\r\n            confirming changes that will allow any member anywhere to input and express their opinions or offer their\r\n            help.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Ideas, the larger tasks, and planning will all be finalised in meetings which are held at least twice a week\r\n            with this number ramping up in the final week. All members of the team are asked to attend any meeting they\r\n            can and if there is a serious subject they are looking to raise, then it falls to them to organise a meeting\r\n            and having anyone who can join attend is the most important part. Typically, our team meetings take place\r\n            any time after 5-6pm Melbourne time and range from 30 mins to 1 1/2hours. These meetings are finalised with\r\n            either notes being sent to everyone student email or withing the specific chat for that meeting itself.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The meetings went very well in Assignment two, as they were pre-planned and scheduled in advance from the\r\n            start of the project to the end.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            In Assignment Two there were periods of time where certain members for the group were unreachable and this\r\n            is a complication that as a team we will need to work together to overcome. Obviously, it is not an ideal\r\n            situation but delegating any work that is over due to active members of the group is our backup plan for\r\n            unresponsive members. They will try to be contacted through other means outside of Teams through Email or\r\n            Discord and if they continued to be unresponsive then they may be removed from future planning.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            For this assignment less meetings were scheduled to allow more time for people to work on tasks\r\n            uninterrupted.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport Accordion from \"@material-ui/core/Accordion\";\r\nimport AccordionSummary from \"@material-ui/core/AccordionSummary\";\r\nimport AccordionDetails from \"@material-ui/core/AccordionDetails\";\r\nimport Card from \"@material-ui/core/Card\";\r\nimport CardContent from \"@material-ui/core/CardContent\";\r\nimport CardMedia from \"@material-ui/core/CardMedia\";\r\nimport CardActions from \"@material-ui/core/CardActions\";\r\nimport ExpandMoreIcon from \"@material-ui/icons/ExpandMore\";\r\nimport grey from \"@material-ui/core/colors/grey\";\r\nimport Button from \"@material-ui/core/Button\";\r\n\r\nexport default class ToolCard extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Card id=\"card-custom\">\r\n          <CardContent id=\"card-custom-content\">\r\n            <Accordion id=\"accordion-custom\">\r\n              <AccordionSummary\r\n                expandIcon={\r\n                  <ExpandMoreIcon\r\n                    style={{ color: grey[50] }}\r\n                    fontSize=\"large\"\r\n                  />\r\n                }\r\n              >\r\n                <strong>{this.props.tool}</strong>\r\n              </AccordionSummary>\r\n              <AccordionDetails>{this.props.children}</AccordionDetails>\r\n            </Accordion>\r\n          </CardContent>\r\n          <div style={{ display: \"block\" }}>\r\n            <CardMedia\r\n              id=\"card-custom-media\"\r\n              image={this.props.toolImage}\r\n              title={this.props.tool}\r\n            />\r\n            <CardActions>\r\n              <Button\r\n                href={this.props.link}\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n                size=\"large\"\r\n                style={{ color: \"white\", backgroundColor: \"#2c3136\" }}\r\n              >\r\n                Learn More\r\n              </Button>\r\n            </CardActions>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </Card>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/github.69ffd9cd.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/teams.2e8c526e.webp\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/office.99e51580.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/java.5e8cb917.svg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Raspi.e3d5f8e4.webp\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/microSD.8684395c.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/lm35.8e897cb6.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/SGP30.f9864002.webp\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/MQ3.0c1f3431.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/breadboard.564fdf71.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/starter.da5b324f.jpg\";","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ContentCard from \"../../components/ContentCard\";\r\nimport Endnote from \"../../components/Endnote\";\r\nimport ToolCard from \"../../components/ToolCard\";\r\n\r\nimport GitHub from \"../../assets/images/tools/github.png\"\r\nimport Teams from \"../../assets/images/tools/teams.webp\"\r\nimport Office from \"../../assets/images/tools/office.png\"\r\nimport Java from \"../../assets/images/tools/java.svg\"\r\nimport RPi from \"../../assets/images/tools/Raspi.webp\"\r\nimport MicroSD from \"../../assets/images/tools/microSD.png\"\r\nimport LM35 from \"../../assets/images/tools/lm35.jpg\"\r\nimport SGP30 from \"../../assets/images/tools/SGP30.webp\"\r\nimport MQ3 from \"../../assets/images/tools/MQ3.jpeg\"\r\nimport Breadboard from \"../../assets/images/tools/breadboard.jpg\"\r\nimport StarterKit from \"../../assets/images/tools/starter.jpg\"\r\n\r\nexport default class Practical extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <ContentCard align=\"center\" width=\"400px\">\r\n          <h2>Practical</h2>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Scope and Limit</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <b><u>Phase one:</u></b>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The initial phase is just to be able to have data readings available using this device and an application.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            This will specifically read and report temperature (both ambient and brew), carbon dioxide levels and lastly\r\n            alcohol vapor.

For this to be achievable we will need servers and data storage facilities.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Naturally this will mean that the data collection would extend to 100s of different beer types and allow for\r\n            user input to allow custom beers to be created and even added to a community portal for user added templates\r\n            that can be shared and used by anyone.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <b><u>Phase Five:</u></b>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            After the above, being able to have multiple systems that can allow for greater control over the\r\n            fermentation process, even being able to automate the kegging process once a brew has completed fermentation\r\n            and been cold crashed. This will of course require far more sensors, moving parts and data collection\r\n            devices but would allow even further automation of the process past the initial brew. Something of this\r\n            scale would possibly be able to even move past the homebrewer and into craft breweries and possibly larger\r\n            companies as well.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Tools and Tech</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <b>Collaborative Tools:</b>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <ToolCard\r\n            tool=\"GitHub\"\r\n            toolImage={GitHub}\r\n            link=\"https://github.com/about\"\r\n          >\r\n            <p>\r\n              GitHub is being used to store our code for the project and for our website.

Additionally, it will require both a heating belt and refrigeration\r\n            system which can be coupled up with a system such as the Inkbird Wireless Temperature controller\r\n            <Endnote\r\n              tooltip=\"2\"\r\n              placement=\"bottom\"\r\n              note=\"Inkbird ITC-308 WiFi Digital Temperature Controller 220V Outlet Thermostat, 2-Stage, 2200w, w/Sensor Smart Thermostat Google Alexa IFTTT APP Support Remote Monitor Control: Amazon.com.au: Kitchen\"\r\n              link=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Inkbird-ITC-308-Temperature-Controller-Thermostat/dp/B07Q2VTWNK\"\r\n            />\r\n            .\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Once a brew has been added to the fermenter, that will need to be placed inside the fridge and have a heat\r\n            belt attached.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The device itself will sit in a space above the fermenter, ideally in the top section of the fridge so that\r\n            it can record the ambient temperature as well as the gases that are being detected.

These will allow the data to be checked off against what is being reported, allowing for live\r\n            results and changes to be made as the brew progresses.

While using\r\n            Raspberry Pi is exactly like using a PC (it is a PC after all) building the additional components and wiring\r\n            them up using a breadboard and various Arduino components. While this part is not incredibly difficult and\r\n            there are a lot of guides out there on how to do it, you still must have some manual manipulation skill as\r\n            well as a basic understanding of electronics and computing.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Once the breadboard is built and all the sensors have been attached then you need to connect the breadboard\r\n            to the Raspberry Pi, then use a program such as PuTTY to SSH into the Raspberry Pi, this does not come\r\n            easily for a lot of people.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            In order to achieve this, you will need to have a basic understanding of Linux, specially the CLI (Command\r\n            Line Interface) to be able to “talk” to the sensors. This will also need some python libraries. Admittedly\r\n            if you have no programming experience it will seem daunting. A team would need to have someone who can\r\n            program in Python or the project is dead in the water.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            One of the main risks to the project here is that most users are only familiar with Windows or MacOS, so\r\n            there will be a learning curve and a fairly steep one at that if you have never seen anything other than the\r\n            basic home operating systems.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Thankfully, the vast majority of the code needed is open source, freely available online and can be\r\n            copy-pasted into the CLI to run a program using Python (most often) or similar (C/C++ and Scratch), which\r\n            will then allow data to be read.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Another risk is that the Raspberry Pi systems are not overly cheap, with the R-Pi coming in at an entry\r\n            price of $80-120 AUD, excluding all the extra components. A single prototype could run to $200 AUD easily\r\n            which is an expensive addition that home brewers may not wish to spend.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            It may be better to use an Arduino board in lieu of the R-Pi, as it is a much simpler system, but we will\r\n            not know this for sure until after the prototype is built and tested. It is likely that we have gone the\r\n            wrong way around on this, but you cannot be sure until after prototyping is completed.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Some of the components, especially the gas/alcohol sensors may require calibration before/after use which\r\n            could cause the system to malfunction if not done properly.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            There is also the ultimate risk, in that it does not read the data accurately, failing to see the correct\r\n            temperatures and therefore having a totally pointless system that cost time and money to be a paperweight.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/CCS.a68df8e2.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/CP.30529db3.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/QA.68ad59c5.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/UDB.383d89b1.png\";","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ContentCard from \"../components/ContentCard\";\r\nimport Container from \"react-bootstrap/Container\";\r\n\r\nimport CCS from \"../assets/images/project/CCS.png\"\r\nimport CP from \"../assets/images/project/CP.png\"\r\nimport QA from \"../assets/images/project/QA.png\"\r\nimport UDB from \"../assets/images/project/UDB.png\"\r\n\r\nexport default class SkillsJobs extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Container>\r\n        <ContentCard align=\"center\" width=\"400px\">\r\n          <h2>Skills and Jobs</h2>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <p>\r\n            4 positions to take the project to the next phase.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <u>Cloud Computing Specialist:</u>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            This project is very data dense having so much information stored in one device would make data processing\r\n            quite slow and information could be relayed on a slower rate than usual. If this project were to take the\r\n            next step it would be to have more and more capability to store data, cloud computing and its glory would\r\n            allow for more information about different environments and temperatures to be stored inside the devices\r\n            allowing more data to be accessible to people, which in return would let people have more suitable brewing\r\n            opportunities.

The influence that having someone\r\n            listening to feedback and relaying to the information to the development team is one that is high and very\r\n            crucial because with a good content plan / planner you can ensure that the effort being put into the further\r\n            development of the app will return in reliable results. The content planner will need a deep understanding\r\n            of team communications and behaviour they would also need to have the necessary technical knowledge of how\r\n            the applications works, the technologies used and what the objective is for the app. This could also fall\r\n            under Project Management, so ideally someone with PMP and/or Agile Certified Practitioner certifications\r\n            would be desirable.

With quality assurance being an important asset to the growth of the project\r\n            the person holding the title of quality assurance will need a very large knowledge into Raspberry Pi,\r\n            Ardunio, ISpindel and an addition knowledge on how the brewing process is worked / used.

The ability to have assigned tasks be done within a day and\r\n              have the work be so detailed and insightful was a very good aspect we had. Everyone helped one another, if\r\n              someone had finished a task, they would offer their services to anyone who needed help, but the most\r\n              impressive thing quality of the group was that we all had different things to do in our life, but we still\r\n              managed to make an amazing assignment with detailed description and an amazing website to go with it,\r\n              everyone played a role and smashed the role.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              The one thing the whole group should improve on in future assignments is communications, everyone in the\r\n              group had lives to live and I cannot argue with that, but if we had improved on informing the group on\r\n              each other’s progress faster and more accurately the work would have gone much faster. This group was\r\n              fascinating from the start, we had people working full time, on a fly-in-fly-out schedule, working night\r\n              shifts and people for their age being so talented behind a keyboard.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              The surprising / impressive quality was how we all somehow managed to get work done in a short time,\r\n              having so many matters and responsibilities in our personal\r\n              lives really affected the project but being able to make the assignment was surprising / impressive. The\r\n              one thing I learned from this group was that being open and honest about your work really helps, being\r\n              scared to let your team know how slow your progress is going will not help anyone. Being honest will make\r\n              everyone happy around the group as everyone will have that team spirit to help one another to get the work\r\n              done because everyone has that common goal, and everyone wants to share the feeling of having the main\r\n              goal achieved.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              One person not being open about their progress on their work will hinder everyone else’s progress but\r\n              being honest will not hurt anyone. The teams GitHub activity I think is fair, I know that I am not the\r\n              best at coding and making adjustment, so I knew that letting the maestros do their business in the GitHub\r\n              activity was the best course of action for me and the team.\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <b><u><h3>Oscar:</h3></u></b>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <b>What went well?</b>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              While not all group members were willing to take on tasks when asked, those that did performed amazingly\r\n              and used the collaboration tools in Microsoft Teams effectively. The team members shared as much as work\r\n              they could with the writing side and helped to refine the work being produced.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <b>What could be improved?</b>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              All the group members, myself included, had trouble with slacking off in some way or another to different\r\n              degrees. We also could have started working earlier instead of waiting a few weeks after our last\r\n              assessment to begin on this one. This may be in part due to no one stepping up and acting in a\r\n              “management” role unlike we had in the first group assignment.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <b>Something surprising</b>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              I found it surprising how well we managed to pull together, those of us that attended anyway, and helped\r\n              each other with advice and suggestions. It was great to see an open discussion that resulted in a positive\r\n              team environment. Being the youngest person in the team it was surprising how much respect the team gave\r\n              me and trust they placed in me with my programming/GitHub skills.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <b>Something learned about groups.</b>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Working in groups is difficult but rewarding. I learnt that in every group there are going to be people\r\n              that don't contribute as much as others, and some will always step up and go above and beyond to ensure\r\n              everyone in the team is able to achieve as much as they can. I find that while I like being in a team, I\r\n              do prefer to be somewhat left to my own devices.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <b>Log of activity</b>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              The GitHub repository does not accurately represent the group’s participation towards to completion of\r\n              this assignment as the thick of the work done by the group was on writing in word documents and manually\r\n              assembling physical versions of the device.\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <b><u><h3>Hans:</h3></u></b>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          The TapeSide group is an amazing group of individuals that sparks wonders, creativity, and inspiration.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          The ability to conceive different ideas and identify which ones are the most plausible is astonishing and was\r\n          demonstrated with the new project idea. Members were extremely helpful, friendly, and quick responders to\r\n          questions/messages and instantly offered their aid and opinions to solve anything, though the most commendable\r\n          feature of the group was the understanding of each members personal life and circumstances and flexed around\r\n          it, producing an amazing website filled with the work accomplished by each member and the level of detail the\r\n          content consisted of.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          Being upfront and honest with the current circumstances and predicaments that I was in would need to be\r\n          completely reworked and improved, as this impacted the group. Parts of my assigned work was given to others\r\n          further burdening the members from their own work and life. Personally, the lack of communication left bitter\r\n          taste to the group no matter the quality of the work I produced as this many inconveniences to everyone and is\r\n          something that I am disappointed about myself.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          The flabbergasting part was the diversity and differences of the members of the group consisting of different\r\n          age, background, and lifestyle brackets and the talent that each member has. Some members have knowledge and\r\n          talent in coding considering their age, and others have talent in writing well detailed content for the\r\n          project. The outcome of the complete project was far more impressive than originally thought considering it\r\n          being a first time for the group to create something of this caliber, whilst adjusting everyone’s personal\r\n          life to complete.\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          Lesson learnt that being more direct with the circumstances and predicaments that one is currently, allows the\r\n          group to quickly and easily subside the problem that it will cause and will prevent the bitter taste to the\r\n          members.\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n      </Container>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nexport default class Error extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <p>Error: Page does not exist!</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React, {Component} from 'react';\r\nimport {HashRouter, Redirect, Route, Switch} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nimport Header from \"./components/Header\";\r\nimport Footer from \"./components/Footer\";\r\n\r\nimport Tools from \"./pages/Tools\";\r\nimport Team from './pages/Team';\r\n\r\nimport Overview from \"./pages/Project/Overview\"\r\nimport Description from \"./pages/Project/Description\";\r\nimport Theory from \"./pages/Project/Theory\";\r\nimport Practical from \"./pages/Project/Practical\";\r\n\r\nimport SkillsJobs from \"./pages/SkillsJobs\";\r\nimport GroupReflections from \"./pages/GroupReflections\"\r\n\r\nimport Error from './pages/Error';\r\n\r\nexport default class App extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <HashRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <Header/>\r\n          <Switch>\r\n            <Route path=\"/\" exact>\r\n              <Redirect to=\"/team\"/>\r\n            </Route>\r\n            <Route path=\"/team\" component={Team}/>\r\n            <Route path=\"/tools\" component={Tools}/>\r\n            <Route\r\n              path=\"/project\"\r\n              render={({match: {url}}) => (\r\n                <>\r\n                  <Route path={`${url}/`} exact>\r\n                    <Redirect to={`${url}/description`}/>\r\n                  </Route>\r\n                  <Route path={`${url}/overview`} component={Overview}/>\r\n                  <Route path={`${url}/description`} component={Description}/>\r\n                  <Route path={`${url}/theory`} component={Theory}/>\r\n                  <Route path={`${url}/practical`} component={Practical}/>\r\n                </>\r\n              )}\r\n            />\r\n            <Route path=\"/skills\" component={SkillsJobs}/>\r\n            <Route path=\"/reflections\" component={GroupReflections}/>\r\n            <Route component={Error}/>\r\n          </Switch>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <Footer/>\r\n      </HashRouter>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\r\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\r\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\r\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\r\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\r\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\r\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\r\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default reportWebVitals;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport './assets/scss/index.scss';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <React.StrictMode>\r\n    <App />\r\n  </React.StrictMode>,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n\r\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\r\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\r\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
