Agile methodology will be beneficial to the production of Digiwave because it gives more control to the Project Manager Professional (PMP) who oversees the whole apps creation, Agile also allows the team to be more flexible in its ability to adapt to any changes and overcome new changes that were brought up during any tests that were run to test the applications functionality.",Object(f.jsx)("br",{}),Object(f.jsx)("br",{}),"Digiwave app will help many people especially in the streaming world, this app will take dedication and team work to achieve with the necessary skills required Digiwave could make further innovations to make virtual audio available on more platforms."]})]})}}]),a}(n.a.Component),me=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(f.jsxs)(k,{children:[Object(f.jsx)("h1",{children:"Outcome"}),Object(f.jsx)("br",{}),Object(f.jsx)("p",{})]})}}]),a}(n.a.Component),pe=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(f.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(f.jsx)(k,{align:"center",children:Object(f.jsx)("h2",{children:"Project"})}),Object(f.jsx)(le,{}),Object(f.jsx)(he,{}),Object(f.jsx)(de,{}),Object(f.jsx)(ue,{}),Object(f.jsx)(be,{}),Object(f.jsx)(me,{})]})}}]),a}(n.a.Component),je=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(f.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(f.jsx)(y,{}),Object(f.jsx)(pe,{}),Object(f.jsx)(v,{})]})}}]),a}(n.a.Component),fe=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(f.jsx)("div",{children:Object(f.jsx)("p",{children:"Error: Page does not exist!"})})}}]),a}(n.a.Component),ge=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(f.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(f.jsx)(y,{}),Object(f.jsx)(fe,{}),Object(f.jsx)(v,{})]})}}]),a}(n.a.Component),ye=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(f.jsx)(d.HashRouter,{basename:"/Tapeside-Website",children:Object(f.jsx)("div",{children:Object(f.jsxs)(u.g,{children:[Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/",component:O,exact:!0}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/team",component:U}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/tools",component:T}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/ideal-jobs",component:J}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/work",component:K}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/tech",render:function(e){var t=e.match.url;return Object(f.jsxs)(f.Fragment,{children:[Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/"),component:$,exact:!0}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/cloud"),component:ae}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/cybersecurity"),component:ne}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/machine-learning"),component:se}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/robotics"),component:ce})]})}}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/project",component:je}),Object(f.jsx)(u.d,{component:ge})]})})})}}]),a}(i.Component),we=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&a.e(3).then(a.bind(null,147)).then((function(t){var a=t.getCLS,i=t.getFID,n=t.getFCP,o=t.getLCP,s=t.getTTFB;a(e),i(e),n(e),o(e),s(e)}))};s.a.render(Object(f.jsx)(n.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(f.jsx)(ye,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),we()},97:function(e,t,a){}},[[111,1,2]]]);
