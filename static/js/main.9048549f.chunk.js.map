This can only happen if the brew is within a certain temperature range that\r\n            the yeast is able to survive (and thrive) in, thereby consuming the sugars. This, first of three systems,\r\n            below is designed to read these byproducts then compare them to a database of “what this should look like”.\r\n            After taking that reading, it can communicate with additional units to control temperature, both heating and\r\n            cooling, to ensure the fermentation is proceeding in a desired manner. The outcome of this should be to have\r\n            repeatable brews, initially the lager beer type, that are mostly automated after the wort is placed into the\r\n            fermenter and fermentation fridge.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The first of these is <a target=\"_blank\"\r\n                                     href={\"https://www.circuito.io/app?components=9443,35286,200000,333429,398783\"}>a\r\n            Raspberry Pi with Temp and CO2 sensors</a> as well as an alcohol detector.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <strong>The Pi:</strong>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The base of this unit is a Raspberry Pi 3, Model B\r\n            <Endnote\r\n              tooltip=\"1\"\r\n              placement=\"bottom\"\r\n              note=\"Buy a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B – Raspberry Pi\"\r\n              link=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/\"\r\n            />\r\n            .

The aim for this project is to help home brewers create the optimum fermentation\r\n            environment when making beer. Its purpose, initially, is to remind and instruct users to change temperatures\r\n            whilst in the process of the home brewing. Once the device and app was working as planned it would allow for\r\n            full automation of this process with the users being able to simply monitor (a watched pot never boils!) the\r\n            brews progress. This device would need the user to connect and run the system, as well as any equipment used\r\n            in the brewing process, but this would be straightforward enough so long as they had a small amount of\r\n            computer/gadget literacy. Within the brew, sensors would be used to detect any changes in the fermentation\r\n            and internal data would be put into activated to alert the user that a change has been made to the brew, or\r\n            if set to a manual option then to re-adjust the configuration of their setup.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The goal of this device would be to help home brewers achieve the desired brew. The fermentation is THE MOST\r\n            IMPORTANT step in the brewing process as it controls how the ale’s result will eventually be. A failed\r\n            fermentation can produce off flavours, or worse become undrinkable. The device's goal is to read sensor data\r\n            to see how well the yeast cells are performing within the brew. The key is to keep the consistency of the\r\n            fermentation process at the optimum temperature which is usually around 18-22c, depending on the brew type.\r\n            The reasoning behind keeping the temperature at this range is to produce the ester compounds from the yeast,\r\n            the ester compounds are what gives the beer its flavour this is from the yeast growing and multiplying and\r\n            that creates the ester compound. The yeast is available to create ester from yeast characteristics; wort\r\n            composition and fermentation conditions and this project would assist in the fermentation process creating\r\n            what people want which they “just want beer that tastes like real beer“. A simple process in theory, but in\r\n            practice it has to be carefully monitored and maintained to ensure the final result can be placed into a mug\r\n            and toasted amongst friends (responsibly!)\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Plans and Progress</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <p>\r\n\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Roles</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <ul><strong><u>Roles for the Project</u></strong></ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              Defining roles for such a large project is very useful and can be a huge benefit to a team’s overall\r\n              performance and functionality. Positions being allocated are usually brought upon by themselves since some\r\n              people have certain skills in certain roles, for example having a person who has an excellent\r\n              understanding of app development, operating systems and computing skills are usually given a job as <i>Lead\r\n              Developer</i> and someone who has a creative mind, understands the goals/aims deeply and is not afraid to\r\n              take\r\n              risks should be given a role like a technical designer. Defining roles for participants is very beneficial\r\n              in the grand scheme of things as it bypasses past any unclear air that can cause any tension between the\r\n              team.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Roles can be changed throughout the duration of a project and roles can also be shared if need be.\r\n              Positions in a team are set for functionality to achieve optimum performance, the purpose of having roles\r\n              and positions is to make sure that every single task is accomplished in an orderly way and to not cause\r\n              any confusion or any dilemma, if a certain task is finished and the role thereby becomes no longer needed\r\n              then it is possible for roles to be changed or in a better way shared / helped with. For the benefit of a\r\n              team’s cohesion, it is better to have roles shared and not changed and if someone’s role is changed that\r\n              may cause them to feel like their skills are not wanted but for roles to be shared it creates a sense of\r\n              comradery and great team chemistry plus it shows how well people within a team can work together on the\r\n              same task.\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <ul><strong><u>What roles would we like?</u></strong></ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              For our project there were several defined roles that could have been implemented, but due to the nature\r\n              of the device and its very early stages, these roles are more so “dream roles” to have working on the\r\n              project.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              The first role that was partly defined was the ‘Head Brewer’. This position was a must for the project as\r\n              it needed to create the brews that the device will be monitoring. This person needs to be able to relay\r\n              information to the development team on how a fermentation works and why this device is needed, this role\r\n              is vital for the project because if the project did not have the role of <i>brewer</i> no one would know\r\n              how to\r\n              use the application and give feedback on how the project is achieving its goal of getting <i>“beer that\r\n              takes\r\n              like real beer“.</i>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Had we continued with this trend, the next role would be the role of Software Engineer, this role is\r\n              desired because without a software engineer there would no application/software further down the project\r\n              timeline. This role is the backbone to the future of this project as the job is to create and to design\r\n              the software that can collect and read the data from the device. This role would be considered crucial to\r\n              the project because without a software engineer/’s there simply no project, this role demands knowledge\r\n              into C++ and Python as the project needs these code languages to write with a Raspberry Pi and Arduino.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Given that this is a very data heavy project, another key role would be that of the Data Analyst. This\r\n              role describes itself, but to explain why we would need this is because the purpose of a data analyst is\r\n              to collect, collate and interpret data for the project. They would be able to analyse the data to turn\r\n              into accurate information, which can be used and refined further down the project line. This role is\r\n              defined for its high demand in reading the data and being able to turn the information collected into\r\n              reliable feedback for the team to process and make educated decisions on the next steps.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Finally, the last “dream role” would be a Project Manager qualified with PMP and Agile as they would be\r\n              able to run the entire project from start to finish, while keeping everyone's tasks in check and having\r\n              accountability. As no one in this team has ever met before and everyone is unsure of each other's\r\n              abilities a centralised manager who can direct and manage the project would be an absolute blessing. This\r\n              would be beneficial in ANY team environment, especially one that requires application building and\r\n              testing.\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <ul><strong><u>Why didn’t we choose to allocate roles? </u></strong></ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              Within this project there haven't been any specific roles assigned, mostly in part to everyone being new\r\n              to the Information Technology Project scene. It is hard to define a role as “RedHat Linux Programmer” or\r\n              “Lead Software Engineer” for someone who is, for example, a chef by trade. With that in mind, it is also a\r\n              group assignment and by that virtue all parts of the work needed to be shared out equally or at least as\r\n              equal as everyone's scope and abilities are concerned. Going back to the very first paragraph here,\r\n              “Positions being allocated are usually brought upon by themselves since some people have certain skills in\r\n              certain roles” we trusted everyone to step in and assist where they could do as much as possible. For\r\n              example:\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              Oscar understands GitHub and the website creation much better than Szedhane, but Szedhane can draft\r\n              storyboards and shoot videos comfortably. Miles can type and write 1000s of words quickly but can't edit\r\n              videos as well as Jackson.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              The team also understands that we all work full time jobs while doing this course part time, so the\r\n              important thing is one person is checking to make sure we are progressing and making progress before the\r\n              deadline. We all took turns at checking in and making sure things were going as well as possible.\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              With that being said, we would have our reflections at the end this project to see if our methodology\r\n              worked, or not. The proof will be in the drinking.\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              That role that needs to be defined is the Data Analyst, this role describes itself. The purpose of a\r\n              data analyst is to collect data for the projects device and be able to analyse the data to turn into\r\n              accurate\r\n              information. This role is defined for its high demand in reading the data and being able to turn the\r\n              information collected into reliable feedback to user for creating that “beer that tastes like real beer“.\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Timeframe</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <TableContainer

This only requires a can of malt extract,\r\n            additional sugars (usually in the form of dextrose) and of course the star of the show, yeast. Besides the\r\n            above, you will need a fermenting vessel, typically LDPE, which can hold 30l of wort (the sugar water),\r\n            airlock and some cleaning products. Additionally, it will require both a heating belt and refrigeration\r\n            system which can be coupled up with a system such as the Inkbird Wireless Temperature controller\r\n            <Endnote\r\n              tooltip=\"2\"\r\n              placement=\"bottom\"\r\n              note=\"Inkbird ITC-308 WiFi Digital Temperature Controller 220V Outlet Thermostat, 2-Stage, 2200w, w/Sensor Smart Thermostat Google Alexa IFTTT APP Support Remote Monitor Control: Amazon.com.au: Kitchen\"\r\n              link=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Inkbird-ITC-308-Temperature-Controller-Thermostat/dp/B07Q2VTWNK\"\r\n            />\r\n            .\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Once a brew has been added to the fermenter, that will need to be placed inside the fridge and have a heat\r\n            belt attached.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The device itself will sit in a space above the fermenter, ideally in the top section of the fridge so that\r\n            it can record the ambient temperature as well as the gases that are being detected. Co2 is heavier than air\r\n            but should safely fill the small area of a fridge with relative ease despite this\r\n            <Endnote\r\n              tooltip=\"3\"\r\n              placement=\"bottom\"\r\n              note=\"If CO2 is heavier than air why does it rise?\"\r\n              link=\"https://qr.ae/pGrz96\"\r\n            />\r\n            .

These will allow the data to be checked off against what is being reported, allowing for live\r\n            results and changes to be made as the brew progresses. Thankfully, a usual brew takes around 2 weeks to\r\n            ferment so this allows for plenty of opportunities to run diagnostics on the data capture side.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            We will know we have succeeded when multiple temperate readings are within a 0.5-degree Celsius variance\r\n            compared to analogue over the course of several days, CO2 is being observed within the fridge and any\r\n            estimated alcohol readings are backed up by manual readings taken over a 3-day period at the end of\r\n            fermentation.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            After that we will want to move onto being able to control the temperature based on the successful readings.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Risks</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Some of the risks involved with this project start with being able to build the device. While using\r\n            Raspberry Pi is exactly like using a PC (it is a PC after all) building the additional components and wiring\r\n            them up using a breadboard and various Arduino components. While this part is not incredibly difficult and\r\n            there are a lot of guides out there on how to do it, you still must have some manual manipulation skill as\r\n            well as a basic understanding of electronics and computing.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Once the breadboard is built and all the sensors have been attached then you need to connect the breadboard\r\n            to the Raspberry Pi, then use a program such as PuTTY to SSH into the Raspberry Pi, this does not come\r\n            easily for a lot of people.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            In order to achieve this, you will need to have a basic understanding of Linux, specially the CLI (Command\r\n            Line Interface) to be able to “talk” to the sensors.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            This will also need some python libraries. Admittedly if you have no programming experience it will seem\r\n            daunting. A team would need to have someone who can program in Python or the project is dead in the water.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            One of the main risks to the project here is that most users are only familiar with Windows or MacOS, so\r\n            there will be a learning curve and a fairly steep one at that if you have never seen anything other than the\r\n            basic home operating systems.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Thankfully, the vast majority of the code needed is open source, freely available online and can be\r\n            copy-pasted into the CLI to run a program using Python (most often) or similar (C/C++ and Scratch), which\r\n            will then allow data to be read.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Another risk is that the Raspberry Pi systems are not overly cheap, with the R-Pi coming in at an entry\r\n            price of $80-120 AUD, excluding all the extra components. A single prototype could run to $200 AUD easily\r\n            which is an expensive addition that home brewers may not wish to spend.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            It may be better to use an Arduino board in lieu of the R-Pi, as it is a much simpler system, but we will\r\n            not know this for sure until after the prototype is built and tested.

The cloud computing specialist would need to have a deeper knowledge in SaaS & IaaS, the\r\n            specialist’s expertise would be used to create an infrastructure that allows more than one device to be\r\n            connected to the same network allowing all information to be accessible, the understanding of the Software\r\n            as a Service would be needed to allow different sensor reading to be kept in the large network of data. This\r\n            cloud computing specialist would need to understand how a brewing process is worked and be able to talk to\r\n            the original team on how the stored data is being brought to the users.

The influence that having someone\r\n            listening to feedback and relaying to the information to the development team is one that is high and very\r\n            crucial because with a good content plan / planner you can ensure that the effort being put into the further\r\n            development of the app will return in reliable results. The content planner will need a deep understanding\r\n            of team communications and behaviour they would also need to have the necessary technical knowledge of how\r\n            the applications works, the technologies used and what the objective is for the app. This could also fall\r\n            under Project Management, so ideally someone with PMP and/or Agile Certified Practitioner certifications\r\n            would be desirable. While there is no “minimum experience time” at least a portfolio containing 3-4\r\n            completed projects would be recommended.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <a target={\"_blank\"} href={\"https://www.pmi.org/certifications/agile-acp\"}>Agile Certified Practitioner |\r\n              PMI-ACP</a>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <img src={CP}/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <u>Quality Assurance:</u>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Quality assurance is a must for taking this project into a more developed level, high quality products is\r\n            what makes anything valuable, and this project can be a valuable asset to a number of people and businesses.\r\n            Quality assurance is used for the project to double check that the sensors are up to date, to ensure that\r\n            the hardware being used in suitable for the environments that it will eventually be in and to enable that\r\n            all systems are go for usage. With quality assurance being an important asset to the growth of the project\r\n            the person holding the title of quality assurance will need a very large knowledge into Raspberry Pi,\r\n            Ardunio, ISpindel and an addition knowledge on how the brewing process is worked / used. This person would\r\n            need the managerial skills to give back constructive feedback to the development team this is vital to the\r\n            development to the project because without the constructive feedback from the quality assurance ranks the\r\n            projects improvements will take a slower approach due to the lack of professionalism. For this role it\r\n            wouldn’t need to be a management or senior role but at least someone who has experience in the field, such\r\n            as a Quality Assurance Engineer.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <a target={\"_blank\"}\r\n               href={\"https://www.seek.com.au/job/52306419?type=standout#searchRequestToken=db9e9201-0d5b-4202-ada5-87fd9c74a6bd\"}>QA\r\n              Engineer Job in Sydney - SEEK</a>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <img src={QA}/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <u>UI Designer/Builder:</u>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            A graphical user interface designer/builder would have to be the biggest development into taking the project\r\n            to the next level.

The necessary skills needed for this GUI builder are that they need have knowledge in\r\n            wireframing and be able to input all data from the project. This role is very important and having team\r\n            skills like working with the programmers to input all the data collecting is necessity and having the\r\n            innovative thinking of implementing different ways of alerting user of the change in reading is vital\r\n            knowledge in implementing software like ioBridge API is also very good addition as this application allows\r\n            users to collect data and receive alerts.
