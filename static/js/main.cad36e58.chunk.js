The key is to keep the consistency of the fermentation process at the optimum temperature which is usually around 18-22c, depending on the brew type. The reasoning behind keeping the temperature at this range is to produce the ester compounds from the yeast, the ester compounds are what gives the beer its flavour this is from the yeast growing and multiplying and that creates the ester compound. The yeast is available to create ester from yeast characteristics; wort composition and fermentation conditions and this project would assist in the fermentation process creating what people want which they \u201cjust want beer that tastes like real beer\u201c.
