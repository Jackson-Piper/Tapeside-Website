A copyright ban can have serious repercussions because these bans could potentially lead to a streamers content being erased / brought down from the streaming platform which has a very negative effect on a person\u2019s viewers due to the fact that audiences cannot trust the content to be original and that people who have been caught with the copyright ban use other people\u2019s material to benefit themselves and not the original artist. Copping a copyright ban can come in many forms like lip syncing a song or having a karaoke session on stream could lead to a ",Object(j.jsx)("i",{children:"copyright ban"}),", many people have found a stable income through live streaming their own content like video games, cooking and general chat but a stable income could potentially be taken away if a person has used someone else\u2019s music on their stream without the artists\u2019 permission. Digiwave\u2019s outcome would be to prevent any copyright infringements to be laid upon any streamers and save content creators from being hit with a potential career ending citation from Twitch. Digiwave would be the solution to play specific audio through a virtual audio device, streamers would use Digiwave to prevent themselves from playing copyrighted music and other material which would lead to copyright bans. The virtual audio application would be used to determine where the music is being played out from, the music can be adjusted to go straight to the streamer\u2019s headset. Digiwave can also assist streamers to direct where their microphone audio is being played through, the virtual audio device can allow the streamer to have their audience only listen to their microphone audio whilst the streamer themselves can relax and listen to something completely different. Digiwave can make 9.52 million and more lives better by helping live streamers being caught with the deadly ",Object(j.jsx)("i",{children:"\u201ccopyright strike\u201d"}),"."]})]})}}]),a}(o.a.Component),pe=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(j.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(j.jsx)(k,{align:"center",children:Object(j.jsx)("h2",{children:"Project"})}),Object(j.jsx)(le,{}),Object(j.jsx)(he,{}),Object(j.jsx)(de,{}),Object(j.jsx)(ue,{}),Object(j.jsx)(be,{}),Object(j.jsx)(me,{})]})}}]),a}(o.a.Component),fe=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(j.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(j.jsx)(y,{}),Object(j.jsx)(pe,{}),Object(j.jsx)(v,{})]})}}]),a}(o.a.Component),je=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(j.jsx)("div",{children:Object(j.jsx)("p",{children:"Error: Page does not exist!"})})}}]),a}(o.a.Component),ge=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(j.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(j.jsx)(y,{}),Object(j.jsx)(je,{}),Object(j.jsx)(v,{})]})}}]),a}(o.a.Component),ye=function(e){Object(l.a)(a,e);var t=Object(h.a)(a);function a(){return Object(r.a)(this,a),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(j.jsx)(d.HashRouter,{basename:"/Tapeside-Website",children:Object(j.jsx)("div",{children:Object(j.jsxs)(u.g,{children:[Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/",component:O,exact:!0}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/team",component:U}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/tools",component:C}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/ideal-jobs",component:J}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/work",component:Y}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/tech",render:function(e){var t=e.match.url;return Object(j.jsxs)(j.Fragment,{children:[Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/"),component:$,exact:!0}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/cloud"),component:ae}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/cybersecurity"),component:oe}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/machine-learning"),component:se}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"".concat(t,"/robotics"),component:ce})]})}}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{path:"/project",component:fe}),Object(j.jsx)(u.d,{component:ge})]})})})}}]),a}(i.Component),we=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&a.e(3).then(a.bind(null,147)).then((function(t){var a=t.getCLS,i=t.getFID,o=t.getFCP,n=t.getLCP,s=t.getTTFB;a(e),i(e),o(e),n(e),s(e)}))};s.a.render(Object(j.jsx)(o.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(j.jsx)(ye,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),we()},97:function(e,t,a){}},[[111,1,2]]]);
