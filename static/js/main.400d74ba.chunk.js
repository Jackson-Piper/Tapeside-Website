The aim for this project is to help home brewers create the optimum fermentation environment when making beer. Its purpose, initially, is to remind and instruct users to change temperatures whilst in the process of the home brewing. Once the device and app was working as planned it would allow for full automation of this process with the users being able to simply monitor (a watched pot never boils!) the brews progress. This device would need the user to connect and run the system, as well as any equipment used in the brewing process, but this would be straightforward enough so long as they had a small amount of computer/gadget literacy.

The key is to keep the consistency of the fermentation process at the optimum temperature which is usually around 18-22c, depending on the brew type. The reasoning behind keeping the temperature at this range is to produce the ester compounds from the yeast, the ester compounds are what gives the beer its flavour this is from the yeast growing and multiplying and that creates the ester compound. The yeast is available to create ester from yeast characteristics; wort composition and fermentation conditions and this project would assist in the fermentation process creating what people want which they \u201cjust want beer that tastes like real beer\u201c.
