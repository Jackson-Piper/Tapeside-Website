The broad definition of Cybersecurity is protection from unauthorised or unwarranted access to personal or private data and information, which is especially more important in this modern, digital age. Some of the types of threats that are encompassed by the cybersecurity banner are in the form of Cybercrimes which are usually just singular attacks to obtain money or profit. Cyberattacks (for example, Distributed Denial-of-Service or DDoS) which are performed in order to cause havoc or take down systems \u201cfor the lulz\u201d. Lastly there is Cyberterrorism, which is often politically motivated, attacks made with the intention of causing fear and spreading uncertainty, especially to destabilise and cause unrest. The most common form that general home users will be aware of is the \u201cVirus\u201d or \u201cMalware\u201d, most commonly in the form of unsafe links via emails (phishing) and fake files that install malware. Those are often the bigger threats on home PCs and laptops, but with the rise of mobile technology there are more threats than ever. Luckily, we have all sorts of cybersecurity methods for mobile devices, for example biometrics (fingerprints) that you can use to unlock a phone, but some companies, such as Apple, use facial recognition to allow access to devices. Besides mobile devices, even your home PC has cybersecurity applications, of which there are a lot to choose from like AVG, Avast, Kaspersky and McAfee to name just a few. These programs work by scanning incoming files and/or code that passes through your network traffic",Object(y.jsx)(R,{tooltip:"ii",placement:"bottom",note:"How Does Antivirus Work?
