It also reduces amount of\r\n            code that needs to be written as the components are completely\r\n            reusable.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Another significant advantage to using React.JS is that it is one of\r\n            the fastest web development frameworks currently available and it is\r\n            important that our website is nice and fast so that the user\r\n            experience is streamlined, rather than slow and encumbering.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ToolCard>\r\n        <ToolCard\r\n          tool=\"React Bootstrap\"\r\n          toolImage={ReactBootstrapLogo}\r\n          link=\"https://react-bootstrap.github.io/\"\r\n        >\r\n          <p>\r\n            React Bootstrap is the popular front-end framework, Bootstrap,\r\n            rebuilt for React.

It is very\r\n            similar to Material UI and is essentially another version of\r\n            Material UI. We have chosen to use both React Bootstrap and Material\r\n            UI as React Bootstrap is a much larger library and is built off the\r\n            Bootstrap framework, which is a massive front-end framework, so\r\n            React Bootstrap has many components that Material UI does not have,\r\n            and Material UI has some components that React Bootstrap does not\r\n            have.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ToolCard>\r\n        <ToolCard\r\n          tool=\"Material UI\"\r\n          toolImage={MaterialUILogo}\r\n          link=\"https://material-ui.com/\"\r\n        >\r\n          <p>\r\n            Material UI is a React.JS framework of customisable, pre-built\r\n            components that are used to speed up the development of a website\r\n            written in React. Material UI is used by large companies such as\r\n            NASA, Netflix, Amazon, Shutterstock, and Spotify. This framework has\r\n            been extremely helpful as we have access to more advanced components\r\n            without needing to create them ourselves and then we can customise\r\n            these components to look exactly how we want them to. This has\r\n            greatly benefitted the look and usability of the website from both a\r\n            user’s perspective, and a developer’s perspective.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ToolCard>\r\n        <ToolCard\r\n          tool=\"SASS (SCSS)\"\r\n          toolImage={SassLogo}\r\n          link=\"https://sass-lang.com/\"\r\n        >\r\n          <p>\r\n            According to Wikipedia\r\n            <Endnote\r\n              tooltip=\"i\"\r\n              placement=\"bottom\"\r\n              note=\"Sass (stylesheet language)\"\r\n              link=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)\"\r\n            />\r\n            , “Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or\r\n            compiled into Cascading Style Sheets.

The aim for this project is to help home brewers create the optimum fermentation\r\n            environment when making beer. Its purpose, initially, is to remind and instruct users to change temperatures\r\n            whilst in the process of the home brewing. Once the device and app was working as planned it would allow for\r\n            full automation of this process with the users being able to simply monitor (a watched pot never boils!) the\r\n            brews progress. This device would need the user to connect and run the system, as well as any equipment used\r\n            in the brewing process, but this would be straightforward enough so long as they had a small amount of\r\n            computer/gadget literacy. Within the brew, sensors would be used to detect any changes in the fermentation\r\n            and internal data would be put into activated to alert the user that a change has been made to the brew, or\r\n            if set to a manual option then to re-adjust the configuration of their setup.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            The goal of this device would be to help home brewers achieve the desired brew. The fermentation is THE MOST\r\n            IMPORTANT step in the brewing process as it controls how the ale’s result will eventually be. A failed\r\n            fermentation can produce off flavours, or worse become undrinkable. The device's goal is to read sensor data\r\n            to see how well the yeast cells are performing within the brew. The key is to keep the consistency of the\r\n            fermentation process at the optimum temperature which is usually around 18-22c, depending on the brew type.\r\n            The reasoning behind keeping the temperature at this range is to produce the ester compounds from the yeast,\r\n            the ester compounds are what gives the beer its flavour this is from the yeast growing and multiplying and\r\n            that creates the ester compound. The yeast is available to create ester from yeast characteristics; wort\r\n            composition and fermentation conditions and this project would assist in the fermentation process creating\r\n            what people want which they “just want beer that tastes like real beer“. A simple process in theory, but in\r\n            practice it has to be carefully monitored and maintained to ensure the final result can be placed into a mug\r\n            and toasted amongst friends (responsibly!)\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Plans and Progress</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <p>\r\n\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Roles</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <ul><strong>It is sometimes useful to define roles for particular participants, such as Lead Developer, or\r\n                Technical Designer, or User Interface Designer.</strong></ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              Defining roles for such a large project is very useful and can be a huge benefit to a team’s overall\r\n              performance and functionality. Positions being allocated are usually brought upon by themselves due to the\r\n              fact that some people have certain skills in certain roles, for example having a person who has an\r\n              excellent\r\n              understanding of app development, operating systems and computing skills are usually given a job as <i>Lead\r\n              Developer</i> and someone who has a creative mind, understands the goals/aims deeply and is not afraid to\r\n              take\r\n              risks should be given a role like a technical designer. Defining roles for particular participants is very\r\n              beneficial in the grand scheme of things as it bypasses past any unclear air that can cause any tension\r\n              between the team. For our project, the defining roles are a master brewer someone that understands how the\r\n              fermentation process works next would be a specialist in Raspberry Pi & Arduino because the DIY building\r\n              tools are essential to the creation to the device and application this person would need to be able to\r\n              code\r\n              in C++ to use the Arduino and Python to use the Raspberry pi. Another defining role would have to be a\r\n              REDHAT someone can use open-sourced code.\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <ul><strong>It is also possible that roles are changed from week to week, depending on what needs to be\r\n                done next.</strong></ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              Roles can be changed throughout the duration of a project and roles can also be shared if need be.\r\n              Positions\r\n              in a team are set for functionality to achieve optimum performance, the purpose of having roles and\r\n              positions is to make sure that every single task is accomplished in an orderly way and to not cause any\r\n              confusion or any dilemma, if a certain task is finished and the role thereby becomes no longer needed then\r\n              it is possible for roles to be changed or in a better way shared / helped with. For the benefit of a\r\n              team’s\r\n              cohesion, it is better to have roles shared and not changed and if someone’s role is changed that may\r\n              cause\r\n              them to feel like their skills are not wanted but for roles to be shared it creates a sense of comradery\r\n              and\r\n              great team chemistry plus it shows how well people within a team can work together on the same task.\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <ul><strong>Have you defined any specific roles for your project? If so, describe and justify\r\n                these.</strong></ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              For our project there were a number of defined roles, each role needed to be defined for the success of\r\n              the\r\n              project and for the benefit of a finished project. The first role that was defined was the ‘brewer’ this\r\n              position was a must for the project it needed to be a must because this person needed to be able to relay\r\n              information to the development team on how a fermentation works and why this device is needed , this role\r\n              is\r\n              vital for the project because if the project did not have the role of <i>brewer</i> no one would know how\r\n              to use\r\n              the application and give feedback on how the project is achieving it goal of getting <i>“beer that takes\r\n              like\r\n              real beer“</i>. Next would be the role of Software Engineer, this role is defined because without a\r\n              software\r\n              engineer there would be device or application. This role is the backbone to the project as its job is to\r\n              create and build the device with sensors and be able to design the software that can collect and read the\r\n              data from the device. This defined role is crucial to the project because without a software engineer/’s\r\n              there simply no project, this role demands knowledge into C++ and Python as the project needs these code\r\n              languages to write with a Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The role also calls for the knowledge on how to use a\r\n              Tilt Pi card and how to use iSpindle.\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              That role that needs to be defined is the Data Analyst, this role describes itself. The purpose of a\r\n              data analyst is to collect data for the projects device and be able to analyse the data to turn into\r\n              accurate\r\n              information. This role is defined for its high demand in reading the data and being able to turn the\r\n              information collected into reliable feedback to user for creating that “beer that tastes like real beer“.\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n        <ContentCard>\r\n          <h4><strong>Timeframe</strong></h4>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <TableContainer
