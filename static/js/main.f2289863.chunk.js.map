It is very\r\n            similar to Material UI and is essentially another version of\r\n            Material UI. We have chosen to use both React Bootstrap and Material\r\n            UI as React Bootstrap is a much larger library and is built off the\r\n            Bootstrap framework, which is a massive front-end framework, so\r\n            React Bootstrap has many components that Material UI does not have,\r\n            and Material UI has some components that React Bootstrap does not\r\n            have.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ToolCard>\r\n        <ToolCard\r\n          tool=\"Material UI\"\r\n          toolImage={MaterialUILogo}\r\n          link=\"https://material-ui.com/\"\r\n        >\r\n          <p>\r\n            Material UI is a React.JS framework of customisable, pre-built\r\n            components that are used to speed up the development of a website\r\n            written in React. Material UI is used by large companies such as\r\n            NASA, Netflix, Amazon, Shutterstock, and Spotify. This framework has\r\n            been extremely helpful as we have access to more advanced components\r\n            without needing to create them ourselves and then we can customise\r\n            these components to look exactly how we want them to. This has\r\n            greatly benefitted the look and usability of the website from both a\r\n            user’s perspective, and a developer’s perspective.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </ToolCard>\r\n        <ToolCard\r\n          tool=\"SASS (SCSS)\"\r\n          toolImage={SassLogo}\r\n          link=\"https://sass-lang.com/\"\r\n        >\r\n          <p>\r\n            According to Wikipedia\r\n            <Endnote\r\n              tooltip=\"i\"\r\n              placement=\"bottom\"\r\n              note=\"Sass (stylesheet language)\"\r\n              link=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)\"\r\n            />\r\n            , “Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or\r\n            compiled into Cascading Style Sheets.

Much like\r\n          a regular virtual machine, DigiWave is an application that will allow\r\n          the user greater control and adaptability over their audio needs,\r\n          without all the complexity that is apparent in similar programs that\r\n          priorities functionality over ease of use and user experience. A\r\n          worked example of Tape Side Techs new DigiWave application would be\r\n          the ability to transmit not only your voice but also any other audio\r\n          from different applications that you require, e.g., Spotify, YouTube\r\n          Music etc. The driving force behind this innovative application is to\r\n          allow our target demographic Streamers, the ability to control what\r\n          they hear versus what they want their streams to hear. If a Streamer\r\n          wants to listen to Spotify while they are live without receiving a\r\n          copyright strike, they can set DigiWave to only allow their microphone\r\n          audio and the audio of any application off their choosing instead of\r\n          being stuck broadcasting all audio they are experiencing.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          What does that mean though? Well for someone who uploads a live feed\r\n          of themselves playing videogames, cooking or just hanging out (a\r\n          Streamer) there are certain rules and laws they must follow to not get\r\n          banned, removed and or sued. The biggest of these worries comes in the\r\n          form of Copyright Strikes as these can happen at an instant and are a\r\n          result of licensed music or videos being shown or heard by the\r\n          audience. The issue of copyright strikes is vast and many large online\r\n          personalities will often have to deal with copyright strikes. DigiWave\r\n          will help to alleviate some of the pressure that comes with the\r\n          constant micromanaging of everything being heard by the viewers of the\r\n          stream to better mitigate the risk of these copyright strikes being\r\n          issued.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          Not only will this help to improve the everyday lives of user with\r\n          this added control to their Virtual Audio Machine experience but also\r\n          improve the viewing experience creating better content for the\r\n          Streamer and viewer alike. While primarily targeted towards the\r\n          Streaming community, which has seen incredible growth over the last\r\n          decade, the implications of an easy-to-use Audio Virtual Machine such\r\n          as DigiWave are endless in the online community.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </ContentCard>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ContentCard from \"../ContentCard\";\r\n\r\nexport default class Motivation extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <ContentCard>\r\n        <h1>Motivation</h1>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Intensively searching for a solution to easily and properly manage\r\n          audio sources and devices have been extremely difficult and\r\n          frustrating, as most solutions required either expensive audio\r\n          interfaces or bulky mixers alongside the plethora of cables required.\r\n          There are indeed software-based solutions, however the majority that\r\n          are available require either previous knowledge of audio\r\n          mixing/interfaces, non-beginner-friendly and/or cumbersome which is\r\n          the case of the VB-Audio suite.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          With the peak and current situation of the pandemic which forcibly\r\n          confined everyone within their homes, streaming content either it be\r\n          games, movies, shows, etc. popular platforms –Twitch, YouTube,\r\n          Facebook, and other streaming platforms have bloomed drastically with\r\n          Twitch gaining roughly 5.7 million new creators and other platforms\r\n          underwent the increase of new creators. Growth fulfilled the\r\n          satisfaction of the ever-growing hunger of content by people and a way\r\n          to pass time of lockdown.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          New content creators, especially those who stream will mostly likely\r\n          have to spend time routing their audio through OBS or similar programs\r\n          for their streams. This can be daunting to certain creators due to the\r\n          forementioned reasons above to obtain their desired results, thus\r\n          resulting in TapeSide Technologies creating a software-based audio\r\n          interface/mixer that is both user and beginner friendly.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          This program enables the user to properly, cleanly, and easily adjust\r\n          and control audio of different sources and devices ranging from game\r\n          and chat audio to physical interfaces regarding the user’s skill\r\n          set(s). This approach allows recent/new creators or even individuals\r\n          that require such program to easily control and route audio channels\r\n          to different outputs through the clean and easy to understand\r\n          user-interface.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          Simple and user friendly experience of the software enables non-tech\r\n          savvy people to seamlessly and easily fully control their audio and\r\n          devices to their desire with the limit being their knowledge, and with\r\n          the current alternative programs available only a couple are somewhat\r\n          close to what DigiWave is able to provide to new users.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </ContentCard>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ContentCard from \"../ContentCard\";\r\n\r\nexport default class Overview extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <ContentCard>\r\n        <h1>Description</h1>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          This will be a user friendly and easily accessible tool in most\r\n          streamers application library. A streamer, especially on a platform\r\n          with copyright issues, will be able to run audio and even programs\r\n          though a virtual audio device. The program will be a much more\r\n          simplified and specific version of some existing software, such as\r\n          VoiceMeeter Banana which has an audio mixer built in but this proves\r\n          to be cumbersome and rarely, if ever, used.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          The program will also be miniscule in file size which will be ideal\r\n          for any gamer/streamer looking to maximize storage space, so this\r\n          shouldn’t be more than 100mb which can be downloaded rapidly on almost\r\n          every modern internet and even mobile internet connection. Further to\r\n          this the installer will be a very simple NSIS or Nullsoft Scriptable\r\n          Install System, which is an open-source Windows installer with a lot\r\n          of customization available based on the install script.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          After the installation is complete the application itself will be a\r\n          simple, one page and very user intuitive program written in C++ as\r\n          this will allow for multi-platform applications that allows direct\r\n          access to the audio controllers. The single page app will have\r\n          controls for volume, audio input and output as well as some basic\r\n          volume and equalizer controls. One of the main benefits to an\r\n          application that uses both NSIS and C++ is that this will require\r\n          minimal resource usage, allowing more computational power for the\r\n          streamer to focus on having high quality both audio and visual for\r\n          their streams. Being that this application has such a small file size\r\n          also means that a very minimal cloud footprint is needed. Hosting can\r\n          be done on a small-scale server such as AccuWeb, that is inexpensive\r\n          but reliable.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          The program, from start to finish, should have as little user\r\n          interaction as possible to keep it as simple as possible for all\r\n          levels of streamer. No matter if the user is a complete beginner or\r\n          streaming professional. The goal is to have software that doesn’t\r\n          matter if the user has ever used a mixer or equalizer based program\r\n          before, but this will be an intuitive program that is easy to\r\n          download, install and then utilise.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          After successful implementation within the Windows operating system,\r\n          the application will also be made available on MacOS, some Linux\r\n          builds and even a possible browser extension and possible mobile app\r\n          for social media platforms that use audio as well.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </ContentCard>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ContentCard from \"../ContentCard\";\r\n\r\nexport default class ToolsTech extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <ContentCard>\r\n        <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          For the virtual audio cable to be created, we will need to use the\r\n          Windows Driver Kit (WDK) to develop a custom driver that works with\r\n          the program itself and allow us to control how audio data is passed\r\n          through the virtual cable. The WDK needs to be written with C++ so we\r\n          would use that as the programming language for the entire program to\r\n          simplify the program by not mixing multiple languages together.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          By using C++ there are multiple advantages that we are presented with.\r\n          Firstly, as this is a small program that we want to run fast with low\r\n          impact on the system, it is beneficial that C++ is a compiled\r\n          programming language as it runs faster than if it was an interpreted\r\n          language. We also can do our own garbage collection to finely tune how\r\n          the RAM is used and ensure that the program is not using up resources\r\n          when there is no need for it to do so.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          To create a GUI program in C++ we would use the QT program and\r\n          library. The great thing with QT is that it is easy and fast when it\r\n          comes to developing a UI which means that the team can focus more\r\n          effort into developing skills that we do not already have such as\r\n          creating drivers with the WDK and moving audio data through a program.\r\n          The downside to using QT is that it is only licensed for open-source\r\n          programs unless you buy a QT license (which is very expensive,\r\n          especially once you buy a license for multiple team members).\r\n          Fortunately, this program is to be designed as an open-source\r\n          application, so we will not need to pay for QT licenses.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          Additionally, to ensure that the program is installed and uninstalled\r\n          properly, we will use installation and uninstallation wizards. If we\r\n          do not use these wizards, users could accidentally put files in the\r\n          wrong places or not install the driver properly. When the program is\r\n          being uninstalled, the wizard would ensure that all the files are\r\n          deleted properly, and the driver is removed from the computer so that\r\n          there are not any residual files remaining that the user may overlook\r\n          if they were to remove the program themselves.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          On top of the fact that the installation and uninstallation wizards\r\n          ensure that installation and uninstallation go smoothly, it also\r\n          simplifies these processes for the user, which reinforces the purpose\r\n          of this program being user friendly and not being a hassle to operate,\r\n          and this applies not just in the program itself but also when\r\n          downloading it and deleting it.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </ContentCard>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ContentCard from \"../ContentCard\";\r\n\r\nexport default class Skills extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <ContentCard>\r\n        <h1>Skills Required</h1>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The creation of Digiwave would make a very big movement in the\r\n          streaming and virtual audio realm, allowing music or different types\r\n          of audio through a virtual audio tool. Building such a tool and the\r\n          skills required for such a project can be easily accessed and found\r\n          through online platforms, the skill level required for virtual audio\r\n          application need to be that of an experienced level, whoever is\r\n          developing a virtual audio device needs to have extensive knowledge in\r\n          C++ programming language and in QT to compensate for the input and\r\n          outputs and for Digiwave the feel and looks for the less cluttered and\r\n          easy aesthetic. Developing virtual audio appliances teams should\r\n          approach such a task with the “Agile Methodology” because sound\r\n          software is a very tricky and a broad subject that requires methodical\r\n          and precise sprints and scrum. Having an expert C++ programmer is a\r\n          necessary skill required in the team building Digiwave, C++ will be\r\n          used in conjunction with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and having one\r\n          or more experienced programmers that use C++ will help in the\r\n          development in a virtual audio application. The advantage of using C++\r\n          is that the program language is used for GUI based applications and\r\n          Digiwave will be a GUI based applications which uses Virtual Audio\r\n          cables that allows music or any audio to be played through a computer.\r\n          The major skills for the creation of this app are using C++ and QT,\r\n          using QT is essential to the project’s completion. QT is essential\r\n          because there are so many operating systems (OS) that QT runs off,\r\n          like Linux and Windows/Windows CE this is beneficial to the main\r\n          audience of streamers who want to use the applications of their\r\n          computers. This whole process will be professionally developed using\r\n          the Agile Methodology, using <i>scrums</i> teams benefit from using\r\n          this way of working to continuously improve the product and create a\r\n          seamless workflow. Agile methodology will be beneficial to the\r\n          production of Digiwave because it gives more control to the Project\r\n          Manager Professional (PMP) who oversees the whole apps creation, Agile\r\n          also allows the team to be more flexible in its ability to adapt to\r\n          any changes and overcome new changes that were brought up during any\r\n          tests that were run to test the applications functionality.\r\n          <br />\r\n          <br />\r\n          Digiwave app will help many people especially in the streaming world,\r\n          this app will take dedication and team work to achieve with the\r\n          necessary skills required Digiwave could make further innovations to\r\n          make virtual audio available on more platforms.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </ContentCard>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ContentCard from \"../ContentCard\";\r\n\r\nexport default class Outcome extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <ContentCard>\r\n        <h1>Outcome</h1>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Digiwave’s completion serves to the audience which is casted to the\r\n          large and vast ocean of online streamers. The streaming world is on\r\n          the verge of having some of the largest views in all platforms of\r\n          entertainment because of its raw and live content. One issue live\r\n          streamer have had a hard time trying to deal with is the issue of\r\n          being copyright stricken or as the streamer say to cop a <i>“copyright\r\n          strike”</i>. Twitch is the main platform streamers use but there are many\r\n          other platforms people use to get their live stream content out like\r\n          Mixer and Facebook Gaming, in February 2021 Twitch had 9.52 million\r\n          active streamers on their platform but the common issue all content\r\n          providers on Twitch and other streaming services face is the issue of\r\n          getting caught with a copyright ban. A copyright ban can have serious\r\n          repercussions because these bans could potentially lead to a streamers\r\n          content being erased / brought down from the streaming platform which\r\n          has a very negative effect on a person’s viewers due to the fact that\r\n          audiences cannot trust the content to be original and that people who\r\n          have been caught with the copyright ban use other people’s material to\r\n          benefit themselves and not the original artist. Copping a copyright\r\n          ban can come in many forms like lip syncing a song or having a karaoke\r\n          session on stream could lead to a <i>copyright ban</i>, many people have\r\n          found a stable income through live streaming their own content like\r\n          video games, cooking and general chat but a stable income could\r\n          potentially be taken away if a person has used someone else’s music on\r\n          their stream without the artists’ permission. Digiwave’s outcome would\r\n          be to prevent any copyright infringements to be laid upon any\r\n          streamers and save content creators from being hit with a potential\r\n          career ending citation from Twitch. Digiwave would be the solution to\r\n          play specific audio through a virtual audio device, streamers would\r\n          use Digiwave to prevent themselves from playing copyrighted music and\r\n          other material which would lead to copyright bans. The virtual audio\r\n          application would be used to determine where the music is being played\r\n          out from, the music can be adjusted to go straight to the streamer’s\r\n          headset. Digiwave can also assist streamers to direct where their\r\n          microphone audio is being played through, the virtual audio device can\r\n          allow the streamer to have their audience only listen to their\r\n          microphone audio whilst the streamer themselves can relax and listen\r\n          to something completely different. Digiwave can make 9.52 million and\r\n          more lives better by helping live streamers being caught with the\r\n          deadly <i>“copyright strike”</i>.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </ContentCard>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport ContentCard from \"../ContentCard\";\r\nimport Overview from \"./Overview\";\r\nimport Motivation from \"./Motivation\";\r\nimport Description from \"./Description\";\r\nimport ToolsTech from \"./ToolsTech\";\r\nimport Skills from \"./Skills\";\r\nimport Outcome from \"./Outcome\";\r\n\r\nexport default class Project extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <ContentCard align=\"center\" width=\"400px\">\r\n          <h2>Project</h2>\r\n        </ContentCard>\r\n\r\n        <Overview />\r\n\r\n        <Motivation />\r\n\r\n        <Description />\r\n\r\n        <ToolsTech />\r\n\r\n        <Skills />\r\n\r\n        <Outcome />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport Header from \"../components/Header\";\r\nimport Project from \"../components/Project/Project\";\r\nimport Footer from \"../components/Footer\";\r\nimport Container from \"react-bootstrap/Container\";\r\n\r\nexport default class ProjectPage extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Header />\r\n        <Container>\r\n        <Project />\r\n        </Container>\r\n        <Footer />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nexport default class Error extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <p>Error: Page does not exist!</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport Header from \"../components/Header\";\r\nimport Error from \"../components/Error\";\r\nimport Footer from \"../components/Footer\";\r\n\r\nexport default class ErrorPage extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Header />\r\n        <Error />\r\n        <Footer />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport { HashRouter, Route, Switch, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nimport Home from './pages/HomePage';\r\nimport Tools from './pages/ToolsPage';\r\nimport Team from './pages/TeamPage';\r\nimport IdealJobs from './pages/IdealJobsPage';\r\nimport Project from './pages/ProjectPage';\r\n\r\nimport Error from './pages/ErrorPage';\r\n\r\nexport default class App extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <HashRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <Switch>\r\n            <Route path=\"/\" component={Home} exact>\r\n              <Redirect to=\"/team\" />\r\n            </Route>\r\n            <Route path=\"/team\" component={Team} />\r\n            <Route path=\"/tools\" component={Tools} />\r\n            <Route path=\"/ideal-jobs\" component={IdealJobs} />\r\n            <Route path=\"/project\" component={Project} />\r\n            <Route component={Error} />\r\n          </Switch>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </HashRouter>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\r\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\r\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\r\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\r\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\r\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\r\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\r\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default reportWebVitals;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport './assets/scss/index.scss';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <React.StrictMode>\r\n    <App />\r\n  </React.StrictMode>,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n\r\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\r\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\r\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
