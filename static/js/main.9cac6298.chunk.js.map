Online learning helps students to learn many\r\n            skills like self-learning skills and the skill to responsibly manage\r\n            time for yourself. Cloud computing is heading towards the\r\n            development of upgrading its networking capabilities to handle large\r\n            amounts of mobile devices using the one network so when large\r\n            amounts of students use collaborative services the app or website\r\n            wont crash or lag. Students bring many devices to schools and\r\n            universities which help in a student learning and the likely change\r\n            that schools will see is the growth in network capabilities that\r\n            will allow larger amounts of students to use the school’s services.\r\n            Schools use cloud computing in many ways; teachers use\r\n            collaborative services like zoom and google classroom to stay\r\n            connected to students as well as students using collaborative\r\n            services like Google Docs and One Note, schools implement cloud\r\n            based platforms like Canvas for students to use a hub for submitting\r\n            work and assignments also students also use cloud based\r\n            infrastructure and software services like Google Drive to safely\r\n            store and collect documents pulled from the internet or from their\r\n            own devices. Cloud based services save schools money on expenses\r\n            like paper and printers because most information and documentation\r\n            are moving towards a digital state due to this departments like the\r\n            library are at risk of becoming obsolete due to textbooks and\r\n            documents being digitalized but, the IT departments in schools are\r\n            becoming one of the most valuable for a school’s staff creating\r\n            in-demand jobs for people\r\n            <Endnote\r\n              tooltip=\"xi\"\r\n              placement=\"bottom\"\r\n              note=\"Head in the Clouds: Why Public Schools are Embracing Cloud Computing - Public School Review\"\r\n              link=\"https://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/head-in-the-clouds-why-public-schools-are-embracing-cloud-computing\"\r\n            />\r\n            .\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            This trend of data becoming digitized is quite common in many\r\n            workforces and not only in schools, but industries also that are\r\n            data saturated need the ever-growing cloud-based services so when a\r\n            historical event like a global pandemic happens businesses are ready\r\n            to cope with remote working condition.

Some of the types of threats that are encompassed by\r\n            the cybersecurity banner are in the form of Cybercrimes which are\r\n            usually just singular attacks to obtain money or profit.\r\n            Cyberattacks (for example, Distributed Denial-of-Service or DDoS)\r\n            which are performed in order to cause havoc or take down systems\r\n            “for the lulz”. Lastly there is Cyberterrorism, which is often\r\n            politically motivated, attacks made with the intention of causing\r\n            fear and spreading uncertainty, especially to destabilise and cause\r\n            unrest. The most common form that general home users will be aware\r\n            of is the “Virus” or “Malware”, most commonly in the form of unsafe\r\n            links via emails (phishing) and fake files that install malware.\r\n            Those are often the bigger threats on home PCs and laptops, but with\r\n            the rise of mobile technology there are more threats than ever.\r\n            Luckily, we have all sorts of cybersecurity methods for mobile\r\n            devices, for example biometrics (fingerprints) that you can use to\r\n            unlock a phone, but some companies, such as Apple, use facial\r\n            recognition to allow access to devices. Besides mobile devices, even\r\n            your home PC has cybersecurity applications, of which there are a\r\n            lot to choose from like AVG, Avast, Kaspersky and McAfee to name\r\n            just a few.

This\r\n            seemingly futuristic technology is happening all around you, all the\r\n            time every second of your life, somewhere some unit is using your\r\n            information to make assumptions and alter its systems to “best” suit\r\n            you.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <strong>Why now</strong>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Machine learning has seen a huge jump in popularity and efficiency\r\n            in recent years for several reasons. While the term was coined in\r\n            1959 by Arthur Samuel, it was not until 2010 that it really started\r\n            to take off with the increase of quantity and quality of data being\r\n            able to be provided as everything started to move online and this\r\n            information started to be collected, stored, and used, the ethical\r\n            dilemma of this data collection is still under debate. The computing\r\n            and processing power available now also heavily outclasses all that\r\n            have come before which allows this vast sum of data to have a use,\r\n            parallel to processing power our memory storage capabilities have\r\n            also increased again allowing this much needed data to be stored.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            <strong>Future (3 Years)</strong>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            There are a lot of buzz words floating around when it comes to\r\n            machine learning and the biggest of them is obviously Artificial\r\n            Intelligence (A.I). While we are years and years of a proper\r\n            functioning A.I there are a few of these sci-fi concepts are\r\n            becoming a reality.
