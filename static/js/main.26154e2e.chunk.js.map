Having worked in IT for a while, he decided to study a degree in IT to help with career prospects. Most of his roles in the past decade were either resource management roles, or customer service such as level 1 and 2 support. One of his strong points is in IT Project Management, being able to adapt to work in an Agile manner as well as using waterfall methods if needed.

The broad definition of Cybersecurity is protection from\r\n          unauthorised or unwarranted access to personal or private data and\r\n          information, which is especially more important in this modern,\r\n          digital age. Some of the types of threats that are encompassed by the\r\n          cybersecurity banner are in the form of Cybercrimes which are usually\r\n          just singular attacks to obtain money or profit. Cyberattacks (for\r\n          example, Distributed Denial-of-Service or DDoS) which are performed in\r\n          order to cause havoc or take down systems “for the lulz”. Lastly there\r\n          is Cyberterrorism, which is often politically motivated, attacks made\r\n          with the intention of causing fear and spreading uncertainty,\r\n          especially to destabilise and cause unrest. The most common form that\r\n          general home users will be aware of is the “Virus” or “Malware”, most\r\n          commonly in the form of unsafe links via emails (phishing) and fake\r\n          files that install malware. Those are often the bigger threats on home\r\n          PCs and laptops, but with the rise of mobile technology there are more\r\n          threats than ever. Luckily, we have all sorts of cybersecurity methods\r\n          for mobile devices, for example biometrics (fingerprints) that you can\r\n          use to unlock a phone, but some companies, such as Apple, use facial\r\n          recognition to allow access to devices. Besides mobile devices, even\r\n          your home PC has cybersecurity applications, of which there are a lot\r\n          to choose from like AVG, Avast, Kaspersky and McAfee to name just a\r\n          few. These programs work by scanning incoming files and/or code that\r\n          passes through your network traffic\r\n          <Endnote\r\n            tooltip=\"ii\"\r\n            placement=\"bottom\"\r\n            note=\"How Does Antivirus Work?

It is worth nothing there is a\r\n          difference between Antivirus and Antimalware although the key\r\n          difference is that Antivirus is a more generic service to cover all\r\n          things malicious where antimalware is designed to fend off trojans,\r\n          worms and even ransomware. Using software like mentioned before you\r\n          are able to scan your files and see if you have downloaded any\r\n          malicious software or files by accident without accessing them as yet.\r\n          One of the biggest changes in helping turn the tide on cyberattacks\r\n          will be the implementation of Artificial Intelligence\r\n          <Endnote\r\n            tooltip=\"iii\"\r\n            placement=\"bottom\"\r\n            note=\"Future Of Cybersecurity: 4 Evolving Technologies | Managed IT Services and Cyber Security Services Company | 24 X 7 (teceze.com)\"\r\n            link=\"https://www.teceze.com/future-of-cybersecurity-4-evolving-technologies/\"\r\n          />\r\n          that can adapt and learn which threats to stop without requiring\r\n          intervention by users.
