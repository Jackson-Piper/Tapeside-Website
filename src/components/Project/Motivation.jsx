          Intensively searching for a solution to easily and properly manage
          audio sources and devices have been extremely difficult and
          frustrating, as most solutions required either expensive audio
          interfaces or bulky mixers alongside the plethora of cables required.
          There are indeed software-based solutions, however the majority that
          are available require either previous knowledge of audio
          mixing/interfaces, non-beginner-friendly and/or cumbersome which is
          the case of the VB-Audio suite.

          With the peak and current situation of the pandemic which forcibly
          confined everyone within their homes, streaming content either it be
          games, movies, shows, etc. popular platforms –Twitch, YouTube,
          Facebook, and other streaming platforms have bloomed drastically with
          Twitch gaining roughly 5.7 million new creators and other platforms
          underwent the increase of new creators. Growth fulfilled the
          satisfaction of the ever-growing hunger of content by people and a way
          to pass time of lockdown.

          New content creators, especially those who stream will mostly likely
          have to spend time routing their audio through OBS or similar programs
          for their streams. This can be daunting to certain creators due to the
          forementioned reasons above to obtain their desired results, thus
          resulting in TapeSide Technologies creating a software-based audio
          interface/mixer that is both user and beginner friendly.
          <br />
          <br />
          This program enables the user to properly, cleanly, and easily adjust
          and control audio of different sources and devices ranging from game
          and chat audio to physical interfaces regarding the user’s skill
          set(s). This approach allows recent/new creators or even individuals
          that require such program to easily control and route audio channels
          to different outputs through the clean and easy to understand
          user-interface.
          <br />
          <br />
          Simple and user friendly experience of the software enables non-tech
          savvy people to seamlessly and easily fully control their audio and
          devices to their desire with the limit being their knowledge, and with
          the current alternative programs available only a couple are somewhat
          close to what DigiWave is able to provide to new users.
