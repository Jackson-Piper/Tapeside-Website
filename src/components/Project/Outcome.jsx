          Digiwave’s completion serves to the audience which is casted to the
          large and vast ocean of online streamers. The streaming world is on
          the verge of having some of the largest views in all platforms of
          entertainment because of its raw and live content. One issue live
          streamer have had a hard time trying to deal with is the issue of
          being copyright stricken or as the streamer say to cop a <i>“copyright
          strike”</i>. Twitch is the main platform streamers use but there are many
          other platforms people use to get their live stream content out like
          Mixer and Facebook Gaming, in February 2021 Twitch had 9.52 million
          active streamers on their platform but the common issue all content
          providers on Twitch and other streaming services face is the issue of
          getting caught with a copyright ban. A copyright ban can have serious
          repercussions because these bans could potentially lead to a streamers
          content being erased / brought down from the streaming platform which
          has a very negative effect on a person’s viewers due to the fact that
          audiences cannot trust the content to be original and that people who
          have been caught with the copyright ban use other people’s material to
          benefit themselves and not the original artist. Copping a copyright
          ban can come in many forms like lip syncing a song or having a karaoke
          session on stream could lead to a <i>copyright ban</i>, many people have
          found a stable income through live streaming their own content like
          video games, cooking and general chat but a stable income could
          potentially be taken away if a person has used someone else’s music on
          their stream without the artists’ permission. Digiwave’s outcome would
          be to prevent any copyright infringements to be laid upon any
          streamers and save content creators from being hit with a potential
          career ending citation from Twitch. Digiwave would be the solution to
          play specific audio through a virtual audio device, streamers would
          use Digiwave to prevent themselves from playing copyrighted music and
          other material which would lead to copyright bans. The virtual audio
          application would be used to determine where the music is being played
          out from, the music can be adjusted to go straight to the streamer’s
          headset. Digiwave can also assist streamers to direct where their
          microphone audio is being played through, the virtual audio device can
          allow the streamer to have their audience only listen to their
          microphone audio whilst the streamer themselves can relax and listen
          to something completely different. Digiwave can make 9.52 million and
          more lives better by helping live streamers being caught with the
          deadly <i>“copyright strike”</i>.
