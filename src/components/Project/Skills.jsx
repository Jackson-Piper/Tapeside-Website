          The creation of Digiwave would make a very big movement in the
          streaming and virtual audio realm, allowing music or different types
          of audio through a virtual audio tool. Building such a tool and the
          skills required for such a project can be easily accessed and found
          through online platforms, the skill level required for virtual audio
          application need to be that of an experienced level, whoever is
          developing a virtual audio device needs to have extensive knowledge in
          C++ programming language and in QT to compensate for the input and
          outputs and for Digiwave the feel and looks for the less cluttered and
          easy aesthetic. Developing virtual audio appliances teams should
          approach such a task with the “Agile Methodology” because sound
          software is a very tricky and a broad subject that requires methodical
          and precise sprints and scrum. Having an expert C++ programmer is a
          necessary skill required in the team building Digiwave, C++ will be
          used in conjunction with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and having one
          or more experienced programmers that use C++ will help in the
          development in a virtual audio application. The advantage of using C++
          is that the program language is used for GUI based applications and
          Digiwave will be a GUI based applications which uses Virtual Audio
          cables that allows music or any audio to be played through a computer.
          The major skills for the creation of this app are using C++ and QT,
          using QT is essential to the project’s completion. QT is essential
          because there are so many operating systems (OS) that QT runs off,
          like Linux and Windows/Windows CE this is beneficial to the main
          audience of streamers who want to use the applications of their
          computers. This whole process will be professionally developed using
          the Agile Methodology, using <i>scrums</i> teams benefit from using
          this way of working to continuously improve the product and create a
          seamless workflow. Agile methodology will be beneficial to the
          production of Digiwave because it gives more control to the Project
          Manager Professional (PMP) who oversees the whole apps creation, Agile
          also allows the team to be more flexible in its ability to adapt to
          any changes and overcome new changes that were brought up during any
          tests that were run to test the applications functionality.

          Digiwave app will help many people especially in the streaming world,
          this app will take dedication and team work to achieve with the
          necessary skills required Digiwave could make further innovations to
          make virtual audio available on more platforms.
