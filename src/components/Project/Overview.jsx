          DigiWave is the answer to your virtual audio machine needs. Much like
          a regular virtual machine, DigiWave is an application that will allow
          the user greater control and adaptability over their audio needs,
          without all the complexity that is apparent in similar programs that
          priorities functionality over ease of use and user experience. A
          worked example of Tape Side Techs new DigiWave application would be
          the ability to transmit not only your voice but also any other audio
          from different applications that you require, e.g., Spotify, YouTube
          Music etc. The driving force behind this innovative application is to
          allow our target demographic Streamers, the ability to control what
          they hear versus what they want their streams to hear. If a Streamer
          wants to listen to Spotify while they are live without receiving a
          copyright strike, they can set DigiWave to only allow their microphone
          audio and the audio of any application off their choosing instead of
          being stuck broadcasting all audio they are experiencing.

          What does that mean though? Well for someone who uploads a live feed
          of themselves playing videogames, cooking or just hanging out (a
          Streamer) there are certain rules and laws they must follow to not get
          banned, removed and or sued. The biggest of these worries comes in the
          form of Copyright Strikes as these can happen at an instant and are a
          result of licensed music or videos being shown or heard by the
          audience. The issue of copyright strikes is vast and many large online
          personalities will often have to deal with copyright strikes. DigiWave
          will help to alleviate some of the pressure that comes with the
          constant micromanaging of everything being heard by the viewers of the
          stream to better mitigate the risk of these copyright strikes being
          issued.

          Not only will this help to improve the everyday lives of user with
          this added control to their Virtual Audio Machine experience but also
          improve the viewing experience creating better content for the
          Streamer and viewer alike. While primarily targeted towards the
          Streaming community, which has seen incredible growth over the last
          decade, the implications of an easy-to-use Audio Virtual Machine such
          as DigiWave are endless in the online community.
