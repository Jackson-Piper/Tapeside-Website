            Cloud services and servers are at the forefront of Information
            Technologies. There are three main forms of Cloud based services the
            first being IaaS which is an acronym for Infrastructure as a Service
            next is PaaS which is Platform as a Service and finally there is
            Software as a service in short is SaaS. Most to all companies and
            business’s use cloud-based services to manage their company and use
            it for everyday usage such as information storage. The “cloud” can
            be viewed from a virtual form for its use

            , cloud computing is critical in today’s modern world as so much
            data is being processed within seconds and with cloud, services and
            servers’ companies are able to run smoothly like Amazon. Amazon uses
            cloud computing to use its application worldwide so you can use
            their services wherever and whenever you like

            . Clouds, services and servers help run the largest companies in the
            world right like Amazon, but Cloud computing is available to all
            companies that need its services and servers. Cloud computing is
            extremely critical for many companies because it allows companies to
            save money by not spending large amounts of money on data centres
            and physical servers as purchasing a data centre is awfully
            expensive as data centres cost include software licenses, power cost
            and the cost of connecting networks

            . Cloud computing is very cost effective for many business’s because
            the main expense is paying for a monthly subscription of the desired
            cloud hosting software this would save companies small fortunes.
            Currently cloud computing is used in many different industries
            because of its ability to safely store some sensitive information,
            its ability to process large amounts of data and information plus
            its large network capabilities to reach all over the globe. Today’s
            rendition of cloud computing is usually tailored to a specific need
            of a client, the current trend in today’s workforce is trying to
            digitize information and have the resources available through a
            cloud-based software having the ability to obtain resources from
            anywhere

            . Having to go through a global pandemic whereby people have had to
            endure being in isolation away from work, industries are relying on
            cloud computing to keep everyone safe from an infectious disease and
            at the same time run a workforce. Due to COVID-19 cloud computing is
            especially important in today’s world, the aspect that will be
            seeing the most changes are the Infrastructure as a Service and
            collaborative services this is due to companies improving the
            work-from-home conditions

            . Cloud computing has become an especially important aspect to life
            and to businesses and due to COVID-19 the need for cloud computing
            is at an all time high because the need to have access to resources
            and networks is vital for people to not only have a job but to have
            an education, cloud computing has been a major contributor to
            education due to having the accessibility to information for kids
            and for higher education

            . Schools now moving towards a virtual classroom, online learning is
            becoming immensely popular now because it is much easier for
            students to get degrees and not travel at all plus having
            information at the tip of their fingers makes it a whole lot easier.

            Cloud based services and servers have a very bright future and with
            the recent events that has taken place in our world, cloud computing
            is going to be at the forefront of technological innovations. The
            remote working situation has been vital for the world to be active
            during lockdowns as industries that were built on face-to-face
            interactions such as stock markets, sales and education look to
            build on cloud computing to further their abilities and resources by
            expanding its network capabilities too reach people from afar. The
            issues that these industries faced during the lockdown were
            significant, the stock market was massively hit during the start of
            the global lockdown showing numbers that will be remembered forever
            in history

            . Schools were impacted equally impacted by the lockdown, but cloud
            computing helped teacher and students stay connected via
            collaborative services. Online learning helps students to learn many
            skills like self-learning skills and the skill to responsibly manage
            time for yourself. Cloud computing is heading towards the
            development of upgrading its networking capabilities to handle large
            amounts of mobile devices using the one network so when large
            amounts of students use collaborative services the app or website
            wont crash or lag. Students bring many devices to schools and
            universities which help in a student learning and the likely change
            that schools will see is the growth in network capabilities that
            will allow larger amounts of students to use the school’s services.
            Schools use cloud computing in many ways; teachers use
            collaborative services like zoom and google classroom to stay
            connected to students as well as students using collaborative
            services like Google Docs and One Note, schools implement cloud
            based platforms like Canvas for students to use a hub for submitting
            work and assignments also students also use cloud based
            infrastructure and software services like Google Drive to safely
            store and collect documents pulled from the internet or from their
            own devices. Cloud based services save schools money on expenses
            like paper and printers because most information and documentation
            are moving towards a digital state due to this departments like the
            library are at risk of becoming obsolete due to textbooks and
            documents being digitalized but, the IT departments in schools are
            becoming one of the most valuable for a school’s staff creating
            in-demand jobs for people

            This trend of data becoming digitized is quite common in many
            workforces and not only in schools, but industries also that are
            data saturated need the ever-growing cloud-based services so when a
            historical event like a global pandemic happens businesses are ready
            to cope with remote working condition. Cloud computing has affected
            many people, it has put people out of jobs and with the advancing
            developments into Artificial Intelligence it is likely to put more
            people out of jobs due to companies seeing the cost efficiency AI is
            going to do. AI sounds scary to many because of movies and TV shows
            and AI taking jobs away from people but it will also create a new
            trend of jobs in the IT department as it has shown in history before
            that when innovations change and revolutionize a workforce and
            assets become less in demand other avenues of jobs that derive from
            the major innovation tend to be the next trend of jobs that people

            Cloud based services has affected my life and my families greatly,
            firstly my mother is a teacher, and she has used collaborative
            services to stay connected to her students and it has allowed me to
            attend an online university course to learn about Information
            Technologies. Cloud computing is heavily relied upon in a production
            line workplace, cloud computing is the backbone for the workplace I
            am currently at. Without the ability to continually manage and
            update stock reports production line workforces would be very
            inefficient, and the overall productivity would become greatly
            affected therefore losing money and potentially the business.
