            <strong>What is it?</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Machine learning is the process in which a machine learns to make
            predictions based on a series of data presented to it. This machine
            will then learn to make correlations between data it already has,
            and the new data that it must evaluate and label. A worked example
            of this would be using machine learning to determine weather a drink
            was beer or wine based on its ABV% and color. Other real-life
            examples of machine learning include fraud detection for banks and
            assisting doctors in the healthcare sector with diagnostics. This
            seemingly futuristic technology is happening all around you, all the
            time every second of your life, somewhere some unit is using your
            information to make assumptions and alter its systems to “best” suit
            you.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Why now</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Machine learning has seen a huge jump in popularity and efficiency
            in recent years for several reasons. While the term was coined in
            1959 by Arthur Samuel, it was not until 2010 that it really started
            to take off with the increase of quantity and quality of data being
            able to be provided as everything started to move online and this
            information started to be collected, stored, and used, the ethical
            dilemma of this data collection is still under debate. The computing
            and processing power available now also heavily outclasses all that
            have come before which allows this vast sum of data to have a use,
            parallel to processing power our memory storage capabilities have
            also increased again allowing this much needed data to be stored.

            <strong>Future (3 Years)</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            There are a lot of buzz words floating around when it comes to
            machine learning and the biggest of them is obviously Artificial
            Intelligence (A.I). While we are years and years of a proper
            functioning A.I there are a few of these sci-fi concepts are
            becoming a reality. The biggest will be the implementation of
            quantum computer into machine learning

            />
            . This will vastly accelerate the overall processing, learning and
            increase the capabilities of these systems. Millions and millions
            have been invested into quantum computing machine learning as it is
            clearly the future for many fields including healthcare and medicine

            <strong>Why aren’t we there yet?</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            While we have come a long way forward with computing in the last
            couple of decades, we still have many hurdles that we are yet to
            overcome. The biggest is creating a Machine Learning model that does
            not require starting from scratch every time you need to change the
            unit’s task
            <Endnote

            />
            . The inefficiency of both effort in and computationally complexity
            of these models is what is holding back the large advancements

            />
            . The next step or leap as it will probably be known will come when
            a multifunctioning or multitasking model that can do a multitude of
            different tasks is created according to Jeff Dean a Google Senior
            Fellow

            . This steppingstone between a machine learning to do one task and
            an almost Artificial Intelligence knowing “how to route the
            different pieces of the model that is most appropriate.”

            <strong>Likely Impact</strong>

            <br />
            If you were to investigate the future a few years not much would
            appear to have changed. However underneath the apparent normalcy of
            everyday life there will be hundreds of thousands of different
            personalized devices. The potential impact of algorithms or systems
            that can shift through huge sums of data and come out with
            remarkable accurate results is already being felt all over the
            world.
            <br />
            <br />
            Already we are seeing smart watches dictate the training schedule of
            scores of people based on the information they have gathered or been
            provided by the user. While everyday life may not be impacted to
            heavily robots will start to become more and more common place
            within the business environment. Already we are seeing basic
            warehouse tasks getting given to simple robots or drones and this
            will only increase as the efficiency and “intelligence” of these
            robots increases

            <br />
            Another version of these “robots” that will affect the large
            majority of the population is the rise of the “Self-Driving Car”.
            While commercial planes have used GPS, motion sensor and other
            systems to make pilots almost redundant after takeoff. Car companies
            are now employing similar systems to allow for these cars to drive
            themselves

            . This self-driving system will soon become more and more common
            with each new iteration learning and improving from the last.
            <br />
            <br />
            While there are many positives coming out of these systems there are
            also many ethical dilemmas that also arise. Systems such as facial
            recognition which has been heavily implemented all throughout China
            which raises many ethical questions as to one’s privacy in this
            technological age. The rise of self-driving questions also begs the
            question what happens to the truck drivers and other couriers when
            they are replaced by these autonomous systems. The redundancy and
            replacement of low skilled manual labor will cause waves throughout
            all countries in the worlds as more and more companies will find it
            easier to replace their staff with robots

            <strong>How it will affect you</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            The affects of machine learning can already be felt in anyone’s day
            to day life. Just as the personalized computer and smart phone
            slowly crept into every household so has machine learning. The adds
            you see on your social media platforms are not there by accident,
            they have been chosen based on all the information collected from
            you and tailored to you recent history across all of your devices.
            While no immediate changes will really be felt, slowly as the
            healthcare models improve a better and faster quality of care and
            life will begin to creep in, as will the models predicting
            environmental changes both in weather and climate change. All the
            personal affects each “average joe” will experience will happen in
            such minute amounts that you wont even notice it as it happens.
