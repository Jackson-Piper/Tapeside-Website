            . As technology continue to advance and evolve, the field of
            robotics will continue to advance, evolve, and expand as well into
            different fields of technology. Currently robotics is mainly
            utilized in 5 different industries – Health Care, Agriculture, Food
            Preparation, Manufacturing, and Military

            .Each industry has its unique utilization of the technology albeit
            being an extremely precise surgical robot which enables
            professionals to perform surgery inside the body; exoskeleton to
            assist rehabilitation to paralysed patients; an intelligent and
            automated robot with the ability to cook predetermined meals; bomb
            detecting, and defusing robots used in past/current warfare; aiding
            in the creation and manufacturing of automobiles.

            Healthcare robotics appear in a plethora of areas that directly
            affect the patient’s care, through disinfecting patient rooms and
            operating suites, reducing risks for patients and medical personnel.
            They are also utilized in the traditional manner being in
            laboratories, performing task such as transportation, analysation,
            and storying of samples

            . Major and critical application of robotic is through
            robot-assisted surgery, allowing doctors to perform delicate nano
            surgeries with the combination of professional skills and adaptive
            learning of artificial intelligence resulting in immense precision,
            flexibility, and control than currently possible with conventional

            As the pressure on farmers increase due to the surge of the global
            population and the shortage of labourers, famers have integrated
            numerous technologies to combat the prevailing issues and improve
            efficiency and reduce operation cost within their farm. Some of the
            technologies that have been integrated are mostly autonomous
            robotics ranging in size serve important task such as monitoring the
            health and development of crops on a basis; transportation and
            organisation of inventory; Multi-purpose robot capable of planting
            seeds, watering individual plants; measurement of moisture content
            of the soil; removal of weeds and measure the health of the farm

            . Implementations of robotics on farms allows farmers to somewhat
            relax knowing their farm is working efficiently and properly.

            Military have implemented robotics in warfare for years now as an
            alternative to human soldiers and have been designed to perform a
            broad range of combat specific task, from eliminating opposing
            infantry to target acquisition with frightening efficiency and being
            an alternative to human soldiers they can be deployed in dangerous
            or harsh situations

            . Most notable robots that are used within the military is the
            ever-famous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) used for surveillance
            missions; remote-controlled mine clearing robots; search and rescue
            bots; and plethora more known and classified robotic technology

            With technology advancing greatly each year, the possibilities and
            usability of robotics will skyrocket as well as its availability
            with it becoming more readily available and affordable to the
            consumer market. This allows education institutes to teach
            younglings of the proper use and implantation of technology as
            society and technology begin to merge greater.

            The impact of robotics to society is mixed feelings due to the
            opportunities that it provides and opportunities that decline
            individuals and the concerns of people from relying on technology.
            Mass implementation robotic technology within the industries
            immensely provides society a productivity growth, resulting in
            higher living standards and wages lower pricing of goods and
            services, and an overall greater variety of products and services.
            High-paying opportunities are also created due to the requirements
            of skilled personal as robotics and its complex and intricate
            maintenance and operation is crucial

            It is apparent that low-skilled workers will be replaced and their
            task automated, causing loss of employment and potentially cause; as
            technology advances further the range of potential application and
            roles that robotics can be utilized and occupy will only expand,
            specialized fields and professions such as medical diagnostics and
            even surgical care providers will be affected by the widespread of
            robotics

            . Converting from a robotic workforce would entail in hefty expenses
            in the beginning this, and the overall cost to automate and
            environment will no doubt create obstacles and problems to
            organizations with limited financial resources.

            <br />
            The personal affects that automation possess on my daily life will
            be either by minimal or adequate as depending on the career that I
            pursue will greatly determine how this technology affects me. A
            career like programming revolves my entire work effort into coding
            and software development for these machines/robots, whereas anything
            outside technology will be minimal as during years leading to
            retirement, I believe robotics would have advanced enough to cover
            every work force as certain jobs/work is far greater done manually
            instead of automatically. Certain family members might be affected
            by the technology to the degree that they’ll require to learn to
            work with the technology.
