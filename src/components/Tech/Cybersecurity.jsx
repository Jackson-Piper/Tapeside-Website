            Cybersecurity covers a range of topics – Network Security,
            Application Security, Information Security, Operational Security,
            Disaster recovery and BCP and End User Education

            . The broad definition of Cybersecurity is protection from
            unauthorised or unwarranted access to personal or private data and
            information, which is especially more important in this modern,
            digital age. Some of the types of threats that are encompassed by
            the cybersecurity banner are in the form of Cybercrimes which are
            usually just singular attacks to obtain money or profit.
            Cyberattacks (for example, Distributed Denial-of-Service or DDoS)
            which are performed in order to cause havoc or take down systems
            “for the lulz”. Lastly there is Cyberterrorism, which is often
            politically motivated, attacks made with the intention of causing
            fear and spreading uncertainty, especially to destabilise and cause
            unrest. The most common form that general home users will be aware
            of is the “Virus” or “Malware”, most commonly in the form of unsafe
            links via emails (phishing) and fake files that install malware.
            Those are often the bigger threats on home PCs and laptops, but with
            the rise of mobile technology there are more threats than ever.
            Luckily, we have all sorts of cybersecurity methods for mobile
            devices, for example biometrics (fingerprints) that you can use to
            unlock a phone, but some companies, such as Apple, use facial
            recognition to allow access to devices. Besides mobile devices, even
            your home PC has cybersecurity applications, of which there are a
            lot to choose from like AVG, Avast, Kaspersky and McAfee to name
            just a few. These programs work by scanning incoming files and/or
            code that passes through your network traffic

            and then compares it to a known database of treats and risks, then
            removes the malicious code/files before it can cause any damage to
            your system, files or information. It is worth nothing there is a
            difference between Antivirus and Antimalware although the key
            difference is that Antivirus is a more generic service to cover all
            things malicious where antimalware is designed to fend off trojans,
            worms and even ransomware. Using software like mentioned before you
            are able to scan your files and see if you have downloaded any
            malicious software or files by accident without accessing them as
            yet. One of the biggest changes in helping turn the tide on
            cyberattacks will be the implementation of Artificial Intelligence

            that can adapt and learn which threats to stop without requiring
            intervention by users. As of early 2021, there are 560,000 new
            pieces of malware being detected every day, with over 1 billion
            malware programs out there.

            , those kinds of numbers make it borderline impossible for humans to
            keep up, even with the help of clever programs and dedicated
            resources. This is where the need for Artificial Intelligence has
            arisen from, to be able to listen, look and learn the habits and
            patterns of these viruses and counter them before they become a
            risk. A huge plus to this system would be the ongoing nature of
            machine learning, allowing stronger defences for corporate networks
            as well as end user computing without requiring massive teams of
            people working constantly to stem the tide of newly created viruses
            and malware.

            According to the Victorian Government, the average cost of a
            successful cyberattack on an Australian business is around
            AUD$276,000

            which is a cost most will not be able to wear, leading to closure of
            business and possible bankruptcy. An attack on any individual can
            cause a range of issues, from the obvious financial damage and
            annoyance to identity theft, which can result in thousands and even
            possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of debt, all of
            which will require time to fight legally. There are even cases of
            suicide as result of ransomware emails

            destroyed, leading to her suicide. With better and stronger
            Cybersecurity systems in place, a user’s data is safer than before,
            possibly even able to trawl and delete user data from places on the
            internet. Hopefully one day AI will be able to enter the dark web
            and delete user data, where the average US citizens personal
            information can be bought for as little as USD$8 per person

            . The advent of AI driven Cybersecurity would take the burden off
            human workforces in many ways, starting with home users being able
            to browse the internet safely and risk free, right to corporations
            not having to risk having sensitive user data stolen and posted
            online, especially in the case of the Ashley Madison hack

            where the nature of the information was not just personal but also
            incriminating. When AI is finally adapted to fully encompass
            cybersecurity, the likes of McAfee and AVG may become a thing of the
            past, not being required when an AI guardian system is watching over
            and utilising machine learning to adapt to every threat that could
            pass, in some cases before it even left its production environment.

            Presently cybersecurity is at the front of a lot of users’ minds.
            Asking questions like “is this link legitimate” or “is this another
            scam email”. A recent study found that financial services spend at
            least 10% of their total IT budget on cybersecurity, which can
            equate to USD$3000 per full time employee
            <Endnote

              link="https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/security-essentials/how-to-justify-your-cybersecurity-budget"
            />
            . While 10% may not sound like a huge amount, for a small business
            or start up, that money could be spent in other IT areas, such as
            AWS or Azure and similar IaaS to be able to have more scalability in
            the future. For myself and most other users – the change would
            barely be noticed, browsing the internet and downloading files would
            become a normal and safe task, gone the days of worrying which link
            to click or which file is the safe one to unzip and run. Society, as
            a whole, would take most cyber security systems for granted
            entirely, as it would be out of sight and out of mind to almost
            every user. Shopping and banking online would become even more
            commonplace – a survey showing that 22% of those questioned would
            never shop online for fear of having their data stolen, with almost
            75% of those surveyed saying they did not trust the company itself

            . This was due to fears that the payment platform may be hacked or
            otherwise “watched”. Users who know a solid and reliable
            cybersecurity system is in place would be entirely more likely to at
            least consider the idea of online shopping. This would be a huge
            help to my parents especially who are aging and need to rely more on
            buying things online safely, especially as they grew up in an age
            without cyber threats and aren’t as sure what to be on the lookout
            for.
