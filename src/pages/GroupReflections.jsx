          As a team, those that were able, joined every meeting that was scheduled as well as some unplanned ones.
          Everyone pitched in and asked what needed to be done, asking for help openly and not being afraid to accept
          feedback or any changes that needed to be made.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          We did not handle this assignment as well as Assignment 2. The biggest issue on this one was that no one
          stepped into the manager role to push everyone into getting things done. This isn’t anyone’s fault as I know
          we all have lives and work to deal with, but we also have a responsibility to the commitment that we have made
          in becoming students.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          For me personally I feel like I have let the team down, our Assignment 2 being worked on so hard by everyone
          to only receive a 60/100 was a huge blow to everyone’s morale and I should have spent time making sure that
          everyone was alright and pushing ahead with this new assignment.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          With that in mind we really have not done a very good job on this assignment and I feel like it is safe to say
          that other teams managed much better than we have. In the webinars everyone seems happy and confident that
          they will be finished well ahead of time, but I don’t know if that’s true or they just don’t wish to say they
          are struggling. Me on the other hand - I worry we will not get this done at all or if we do it doesn’t pass
          muster and we all fail. This has been something new I learned about working in groups like this.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          As a team we are a very diverse bunch and of varying levels of IT knowledge, living arrangements, careers and
          goals, so it can be hard for us to align at set times, but I think everyone has done their very best and have
          tried so hard to get this assignment done.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I don’t think we were as thorough as we should have been, our reports missing crucial information that will
          cost us marks.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          It also has been hard having a team of five (instead of six), two of which were essentially uncontactable
          meaning the remaining three team members have had to do the work for everyone.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          It surprised me how well we managed to do, even with the lower numbers – Szedhane and Oscar stepping up and
          really doing an amazing job.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I have learnt that moving forward I think group assignments need someone to “manage” the team. This role is
          one that you just must take the reins and do your best in. You want to be trying to professionally push
          everyone to do their best and really making sure that we are on track or ahead if possible.

          The best thing about our group from the get-go was the diversity of experience and skills from each member. We
          are all at different stages of our life and have all come together to produce two in my opinion amazing
          assignments that I do not think we could have improved much on. Everyone fell into a role that suited them
          best and helped them to achieve the best for the group. I am surprised that it happened so effortlessly and am
          happy to say I’ve been a part of this group, would more than want to work with them in the future.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I think the biggest thing that could have been improved was being honest myself and my communication within
          the team. I had some personal problems that I had to deal with in my private life and unfortunately let this
          impact my teamwork. Communication is something that I acknowledge in all aspects of my life as one of the most
          important things and realising that I let my team down with poor communication and lack of effort is quite
          depressing and not something that I am proud of.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The biggest thing that I was surprised about was the diversity in our team, everyone coming from different
          backgrounds and lifestyles. We had members of our team who were not even old enough to drink yet were running
          rings around us with his code and other members who were working in the IT field already for several years. I
          did not expect to have this large range of diversity within our team.Something I learnt along the way was how
          to improve my formal writing and being able to articulate sentences in ways, so they are formal and
          informational without crossing the line into being ridiculously hard to understand or wordy. This skill is
          something that I have been working on all throughout the course and finally feel like I can see a difference
          between my work now and that work at the beginning.

          Reflection on assignment & group
          <ul>
            <li>
              This group works wonders and work them quick. The ability to have assigned tasks be done within a day and
              have the work be so detailed and insightful was a very good aspect we had. Everyone helped one another, if
              someone had finished a task, they would offer their services to anyone who needed help, but the most
              impressive thing quality of the group was that we all had different things to do in our life, but we still
              managed to make an amazing assignment with detailed description and an amazing website to go with it,
              everyone played a role and smashed the role.
            </li>
            <li>
              The one thing the whole group should improve on in future assignments is communications, everyone in the
              group had lives to live and I cannot argue with that, but if we had improved on informing the group on
              each other’s progress faster and more accurately the work would have gone much faster. This group was
              fascinating from the start, we had people working full time, on a fly-in-fly-out schedule, working night
              shifts and people for their age being so talented behind a keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              The surprising / impressive quality was how we all somehow managed to get work done in a short time,
              having so many matters and responsibilities in our personal
              lives really affected the project but being able to make the assignment was surprising / impressive. The
              one thing I learned from this group was that being open and honest about your work really helps, being
              scared to let your team know how slow your progress is going will not help anyone. Being honest will make
              everyone happy around the group as everyone will have that team spirit to help one another to get the work
              done because everyone has that common goal, and everyone wants to share the feeling of having the main
              goal achieved.
            </li>
            <li>
              One person not being open about their progress on their work will hinder everyone else’s progress but
              being honest will not hurt anyone. The teams GitHub activity I think is fair, I know that I am not the
              best at coding and making adjustment, so I knew that letting the maestros do their business in the GitHub
              activity was the best course of action for me and the team.

              <b>What went well?</b>
              <br/>
              While not all group members were willing to take on tasks when asked, those that did performed amazingly
              and used the collaboration tools in Microsoft Teams effectively. The team members shared as much as work
              they could with the writing side and helped to refine the work being produced.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>What could be improved?</b>
              <br/>
              All the group members, myself included, had trouble with slacking off in some way or another to different
              degrees. We also could have started working earlier instead of waiting a few weeks after our last
              assessment to begin on this one. This may be in part due to no one stepping up and acting in a
              “management” role unlike we had in the first group assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Something surprising</b>
              <br/>
              I found it surprising how well we managed to pull together, those of us that attended anyway, and helped
              each other with advice and suggestions. It was great to see an open discussion that resulted in a positive
              team environment. Being the youngest person in the team it was surprising how much respect the team gave
              me and trust they placed in me with my programming/GitHub skills.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Something learned about groups.</b>
              <br/>
              Working in groups is difficult but rewarding. I learnt that in every group there are going to be people
              that don't contribute as much as others, and some will always step up and go above and beyond to ensure
              everyone in the team is able to achieve as much as they can. I find that while I like being in a team, I
              do prefer to be somewhat left to my own devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Log of activity</b>
              <br/>
              The GitHub repository does not accurately represent the group’s participation towards to completion of
              this assignment as the thick of the work done by the group was on writing in word documents and manually
              assembling physical versions of the device.

          The TapeSide group is an amazing group of individuals that sparks wonders, creativity, and inspiration.
          <br/>
          The ability to conceive different ideas and identify which ones are the most plausible is astonishing and was
          demonstrated with the new project idea. Members were extremely helpful, friendly, and quick responders to
          questions/messages and instantly offered their aid and opinions to solve anything, though the most commendable
          feature of the group was the understanding of each members personal life and circumstances and flexed around
          it, producing an amazing website filled with the work accomplished by each member and the level of detail the
          content consisted of.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Being upfront and honest with the current circumstances and predicaments that I was in would need to be
          completely reworked and improved, as this impacted the group. Parts of my assigned work was given to others
          further burdening the members from their own work and life. Personally, the lack of communication left bitter
          taste to the group no matter the quality of the work I produced as this many inconveniences to everyone and is
          something that I am disappointed about myself.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The flabbergasting part was the diversity and differences of the members of the group consisting of different
          age, background, and lifestyle brackets and the talent that each member has. Some members have knowledge and
          talent in coding considering their age, and others have talent in writing well detailed content for the
          project. The outcome of the complete project was far more impressive than originally thought considering it
          being a first time for the group to create something of this caliber, whilst adjusting everyone’s personal
          life to complete.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Lesson learnt that being more direct with the circumstances and predicaments that one is currently, allows the
          group to quickly and easily subside the problem that it will cause and will prevent the bitter taste to the
          members.
